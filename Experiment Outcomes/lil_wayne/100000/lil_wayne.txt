Six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch
Six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch


Excuse my charisma, vodka with a spritzer
Swagger down pat, call my shit Patricia
Young Money militia, and I am the commissioner
You don't want start Weezy, 'cause the F is for Finisher
So misunderstood, but what's a World without enigma?
Two bitches at the same time, synchronized swimmers
Got the girl twisted 'cause she open when you twist her
Never met the bitch, but I f-ck her like I missed her
Life is the bitch, and death is her sister
Sleep is the cousin, what a f-ckin' family picture
You know father time, we all know mother nature
It's all in the family, but I am of no relation
No matter who's buying, I'm a celebration
Black and white diamonds, f-ck segregation

Young Money running shit and you n-ggas just runner-ups

Six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch


I'm going back in
Okay, I lost my mind, it's somewhere out there stranded
I think you stand under me if you don't understand me
Had my heart broken by this woman named Tammy
But hoes gon' be hoes, so I couldn't blame Tammy
Just talked to moms, told her she the sweetest
I beat the beat up, call it self defense
Swear man, I be seeing through these n-ggas like sequins
N-ggas think they He-Men, pow, pow, the end
Talking to myself because I am my own consultant
Married to the money, f-ck the world, that's adultery
You full of sh-t, you close your mouth and let yo ass talk


Young Money eating, all you haters do is add salt
Stop playing, bitch, I got this game on deadbolt
Mind so sharp, I f-ck around and cut my head off
Real n-gga all day and tomorrow
But these muthaf-ckas talking crazy like they jaw broke
Glass half empty, half full, I'll spill ya
Try me and run into a wall, outfielder
You know I'ma ball 'til they turn off the field lights
The fruits of my labor, I enjoy 'em while they still ripe
Bitch, stop playing, I do it like a king do
If these n-ggas animals, then I'ma have a mink soon
Tell 'em bitches I say put my name on the wall
I speak the truth, but I guess that's a foreign language to y'all
And I call it like I see it, and my glasses on
But most of y'all don't get the picture 'less the flash is on
Satisfied with nothing, you don't know the half of it
Young Money, Cash Money
Paper chasing, tell that paper, "Look, I'm right behind ya"
Bitch, real G's move in silence like lasagna
People say I'm borderline crazy, sorta kinda
Woman of my dreams, I don't sleep so I can't find her
You n-ggas are gelatin, peanuts to an elephant
I got through that sentence like a subject and a predicate
Yeah, with a swag you would kill for
Money too strong, pockets on bodybuilder
Jumped in a wishing well, now wish me well
Tell 'em kiss my ass, call it kiss and tell


Word to my mama, I'm out of my lima bean
Don't wanna see what that drama mean, get some Dramamine
Llama scream, hotter than summer sun on a Ghana queen
Now all I want is hits, bitch, Wayne signed a fiend
I played the side for you n-ggas that's tryna front, and see
Son of Gunz, Son of Sam, you n-ggas the son of me
Pause for this dumber speech, I glow like Buddha
Disturb me, and you'll be all over the flow like Luda
Bitch, I flow like scuba, bitch, I'm bald like Cuba
And I keep a killer ho, she gon' blow right through ya
I be macking, 'bout my stacking, now I pack like a mover
Shout to ratchet for backing out on behalf of my shooter
N-ggas think they high as I, I come laugh at your ruler
Cash Money cold, bitch, but our actions is cooler
Wayne, these n-ggas out they mind
I done told these f-ck n-ggas, so many times
That I keep these bucks steady on my mind
Tuck these, I f-ck these on your mind, pause
To feed them, on my grind, did I get a little love?
Keep throwing my sign in the middle
Hit 'em up, piece on my side, 'cause ain't no peace on my side, bitch
I'm a man, I visit urinals abroad
Tune told me to, I'm shooting when the funeral outside
I'm uptown, thoroughbred, a bx n-gga, ya heard?
Gunna


{Cassidy speaks in the beginning and between each verse}


Yeah, I go by the name of Cassidy the Hustler
And I brought two of my niggaz with me
And we about to shut the industry down
Aiyyo Wheezy let's get it poppin!


Hit me!
Front that shit this the south side, got a fat dick on your mouth wide
I've come to take outside, nah do it right here
Hop out later owning on everybody's home that you fuckin with
Wheezy F baby, please say the baby
Riding with your bitch got keys on the lady
Triple gold these four tires on the whip
Young Carter sliding out I'm flyer than the whip
Yeah, higher than an angel, or hotter than the devil
The pot or kettle, uh
The metal let 'em burn like Earth shiver births, uh
If there's any beef I come running like Mertz, uh
Word up, eagle street I'm throwing my curve up
We take your ice cream and turn you into sherbert
I got flow I'm like "Sure" but, if it's about dough I'm like "Sure 'nuff"
I'm from the bird bunch, Birdman Jr. You niggaz bird lunch
I see your lips moving but I ain't heard much
You see the wirst moving, it look like pure punch
I hear the playa hating but I don't endorse such
I got the Escalade, guts like the tour bus
I got the styrofoam poured up with syrup
And in the tires little package is gone
Might I spend a good deal with these Firestones
I spit like Myer's bones, born in chromers
For the buyers chromosomes I got summers
I got vicadens, valiums I ain't stopping
Got pot and heroin, ex, oxycontin
And that's how we rocking
How can you hear that bop unless I'm be-bopping
Yeah skip when you hear that click
Cash money nigga I'm that shit
I leave the begging ungh!


That's what I'm talking about
Now Fab, spit at these niggaz and let them know why they ain't fuckin with you


Your goddamn right I'm feeling myself
A chauffeur no sir, I'm wheeling myself
Looking for a chick chilling for self
So I can show her the suicides and talk her into killing herself
I'm having problems dealing with wealth
But you wouldn't understand it, until you get a million yourself
You niggaz must've got a deal for your health
Your cd is frozen food, it just chills on the shelf
I spend big, at any time I can start splurging
The twin cigs open chests like a heart surgeon
And I'm buttoned up, I'm just a blue collar crook
But I keep a stack thick as few college books
I got a new polished look
And twenty dime bitches, to show y'all niggaz how my two dollars look
The boy's got at least six digits on
So the guns gotta be at least midget long
The money, is like ten bridges long
I throw bread around just to turn pigeons on
I got some good smoke just for puffers
The two grand twenty's make the hustlers suffer
Plus it's fluffer, than a cotton ball
I've gotten calls wanting me to put the pot in malls
But nowadays you can't put it past 'em
I got a Dan Marino arm, I'm bout to throw some bullets past 'em
And the niggaz in the hood keep quoting my lines
I don't jump ship I keep floating in mine
Long as I keep toting I'm fine
I'mma have these dick sucking niggaz deep-throating the nine
I jumped in the English ship, Benzed whip
It's Terminator 2 chrome the engines dip
I'm reading scripts no, not the penmanship (no)
The box-office shit (yeah), I box off this bitch (yeah)
Jessica Alba, Kirsten Dunst
And still make a mil' off the first of months
These dudes be the first to front
'Til they family and friends is in limos, they in hearse in front
I'm in the top position, I can make you a proposition
I'm in the hard top waiting on the drop edition
To hell with the patience
I'mma send a nigga down under like Australia vacations


Yeah it is what it is, my niggaz just killed y'all and I'mma close the casket
I'm tryin not to let this industry get the best of me y'all
I work hard in the game, the game's stressing me y'all
All they do is complain what they expect from me y'all
From the hood to Hollywood they respecting me y'all
And even overseas they accepting me y'all
All the ladies show me love, the thugs repping me y'all
I get a lot of dirty money so respect me or fall
But I'm saving all my checks, I'm investing 'em all
They say, what goes up is gon' definitely fall
Even the stars work success, it's my destiny y'all
Look, I cook tracks I got the recipe y'all
You can't name another cat that can mess with me y'all
At the shows all the hoes be molesting me y'all
I got broads crying trying to get next to me y'all
I got broads craving begging to have s** with me y'all
Screaming, "Cash you don't know how sexy you are!"
And I'm happy I'm alive, God's blessing me y'all
And all the problems that arrive is God testing me y'all
So I pray everyday but I ain't praying too much
Cause I be sinning everyday so I ain't praying enough
And we all could be beat, and I ain't saying I'm tough
But if it's beef I don't speak, I ain't saying "What's up"
If it's beef when we meet then I'm spaying shit up
Prraat prraat. I ain't saying too much and that's that
Cause that cat you embracing with love
Might clap that gat cause he got hate in his blood
Keep your friends at a distance and your enemies close
Cause the folks you call friends can envy the most
Some cats'll hang themselves if you give 'em a rope
Burn the bridge and don't give a boat, let 'em sink
Sometimes you gotta give 'em some some time to let 'em think
But sometimes you gotta give 'em the nine and let 'em stink
You can't bring every horse to the pond and let 'em drink
I'd rather keep my eyes wide open instead of blink
As soon as your eyes shut, them niggaz will ride up
And the guys that you trusted be getting you tied up
And we all gotta die, but I ain't ready to leave
That's why even if it's petty I'll be ready to squeeze
But put a cheddar in cheese, guac-a-moola
I pop the ruger, send that hot shit through ya!
Like booya! That's the sound when the pound busting
Ooh, ah, you'll be laying on the ground suffering
Clowning's nothing to pull out and blast you
I try to only resort to violence if I have to
But man niggaz out here are playing fair
So before the odds are even I'm leaving them laying there
And I ain't even playing believe what I'm saying here
Cause before this shit gets further your click gets murdered
And found in a hole in the grass
For trying to play that thug role I'll stomp a mud hole in your ass
And this Cass, nigga I'm that sick
Full Surface nigga I'm that shit, bitch!

I see you with your palms in your pants

I make it spin on my finger
I'm a critical thinker
I'm a hell of a smoker, and a bit of a drinker
I know your name, yea
Your name is "unimportant"
We in the belly of the beast
And she thinking bout abortion


I woke up this morning, dick rock hard
Ashed my blunt in my grammy award
You can save your bullshit on your memory card
If this real nigga business, then you niggas unemployed
Jumped on the celly, called makaveli
He says he was gravy, I say I was jelly
Looked in the mirror, said "you's an I'll nigga"
Now I think I'll have me a coffee with six sugars
In a world full of ass-kissers and dick pullers
I'm trying to walk a straight line but the line crooked
I'm shooting for the stars, astronauts dodge bullets
Yea, I bought a brand new attitude
The haters music to my ears, I got my dancing shoes
Sometimes we question shit that there is no answer to
But I just built a house on "I don't give a fuck" avenue




Down on the ceiling, looking up at the bed
Life is a gamble better check the point spread
And when life sucks, I just enjoy the head
I'm so sick of these niggas, I need meds
Smoking on a hallelujah, thank you jesus
Help me focus on the future, and not the previous
Double are, I'm a rebel with a reason
Sometimes you gotta fight the devil with a demon
Blood is in the streets and it is up to my knees
Underground shit, I see myself as a seed
Living in the glass, and everybody's looking
How can you get the picture, if you don't know who took it?
This current affairs, but who the hell cares?
Everybody's fighting over position, musical chairs
On the road to redemption, go on and use a few stairs
I'm just fucking ready so I come prepared




And the rockets red glare
The bombs bursting in air
Life is a rollercoaster but still unfair
A blessing in disguise
Says thank you for our eyes
But since it is in disguise
We don't know that it's there
And I...


I know your name...


Young desperado straight out the grotto
I'm so bad my shadow chooses not to follow
Little nigga but see me as a fuckin' rhino

In the lane like l'm goin' get a Allie Oupe.
Oops, that was a coupe.
Pass yo' ass like lightning's flash.
Cut the light down now and turn me to a darkchild.
My thoughts fall, my eyelids are scattered.
And we are Young Money, but age doesn't matter.


Ha! I'm so cool! Bird-man, Bird-man, J.R.! You Know! Yup Yup! Yup Yup! BK
See I, Ride when I gotta, grind 'cause I gotta
Milk the game til it's sour.
What I gotta do to bank streets when it's hotter.
Even tho the boy smooth sellin like prada.
Speak Up! the two yellin like holla.
Ya heard me. got the fools bellin like Jackie, persey.
Try and join em' I can help you with that
I'm important in rap with you know special with gats.
You know the young god blessed you in fact, like he sneezed or sumthin.
Even wit a stack of money in they hand they aint squeezin nuthin.
I'm weezy fuck it! Leave a mothafuckin weezin when my ass done pumped em'
And I don't ask for nuthin boy! I only asked and buggy boy!
And ask for money, watch the young god turn cash to money, it's that simple!


(Chorus)
And we aint stressin bout shit
We grindin like a mothafucker tryna stay rich
The cops on my trail so the tracks gotta switch
See niggas with money shouldn't act like this.
Yeah!
And we aint stressin bout shit
We grindin like a mothafucker tryna stay rich
The cops on my trail so the tracks gotta switch
See niggas with money shouldn't act like this.


*Baby's rap*


*Chorus*


Weezy... and I ride to the end of the road.
I'm hotter than the fire on the end of the fo'
And plenty times I had to get it from the floor.
But then I made it to the ceiling and every wall could hear me.
And if these walls could talk, they prolly cry the the strings on a guitar.
And see you, you with that bullshit that's lead way to the dark
Don't make me cut off the lights! GOODNIGHT!


*Baby's rap*


*Chorus*


I Wake Up In The Morning Take A Knee And Thank God,

So we don't do that much talking
Sometimes it feels so awkward
She watch me take a shower
I asked her why she didn't join me
She said because you didn't ask me
I said damn I didn't think I had to
Then she take off my towel and I take off her blouse
I tell her that that pussy for me just incase she thought it was ours
And she say cool


And if you like it I love it
If she like it I love it


See we ain't got much in common
So we don't do that much talking
Coz everytime she try to tell me something
She open up her mouth and I stick my tongue in
She got a piercing in her vagina
A skirt with nothing under


And she say when she don't see me
She feel like Stevie Wonder

She been contemplating short hair.

But she just like the rest of these bitches.
But that's neither here nor there.
And my dick is her chair.
It be sexual warfare, I be loaded like software.
Got so many hoes, I'm ho'in, but she the only one worth knowin'
And yeah I do my dirt, but that's for the flowers to grow in.

They ain't got shit on me, but she keep sniffin'.
Look girl, just gimmie that brain, and I'll return the favor.
Them hoes say I'mma dog, but how come I don't chase 'em.
I lick her with no chaser, I pick her out a line up.

But she been wantin' to break up, since dolce and gabbana.
All that ass I just be like come sit yo groceries on my counter.

Sometimes I think y'all all dykes.
But fuck all that, I'm on one.
Don't wanna be with the wrong one.

So come to me, then come for me.
My game cold, one degree.
I'm rollin' with two bad bitches cuz misery loves company.
One sweet, one sour, my honeybee and my bumblebee.
I miss you in the worst way, ride that dick no speed bumps.
No redlights, no stop lights, just get to Lil' Tunechi.

No Ceilings Got Dammit now the f-ckin Sky's showin uhh!


Call the president he's the next new president
He a senator from Illinois yeah
His criteria compared to John Mccain just isn't fair
Cuz he's b-l-a-c- so the eyes are on he
Through is pencil he write
Legislation with the country on his mind
And he don't cope ish
Cuz he ain't got time
Every second minute hour kkk wanna devour
He got guards ready to pop him
With their ch ch ch ch choppers
Every brother mother sister cousin grandma wanna hump him
Even got Hilary Clinton on the side ready to jump him
Tell the Clintons naaaaaaaaah
Couldn't catch him couldn't stop him
They go by the party rules
If you can't beat 'em you can't top 'em
Thought you'd smack couldn't pop em
Delegates couldn't cop 'em
Bill Clinton couldn't help her
Too bad she couldn't drop him


Man Obama so I'll


Obama goes here, Obama goes there
Sayin' yes we can just like Michelle he sittin' in the deriere
He travel to Arizona ready to cause some drama
Hopin' Mccain don't comment
Look at that bastard Obama
He's too young he's too hip
Negroes always causing problems
His pale lookin' face got him lookin' like a goblin
Mccain Mccain please don't vote for Mccain
First they up in office talkin' bout some heart pain
Call the ambulance quick all you hear is sirens
His temper isn't private
Dang I hate a mad prick
Don't you had a mad prick
Plus Mccains an old prick
Barack's a yonger guy so choose him
He's the right pick
But if you choose the wrong pick
Your step-son will probably end up in Iraq quick


His health care plan is so immaculate
So even if you broke you can afford to take a doc trip
You'll be feelin' much better not sick
And he's ok but his wife's sick
And her back's thick and her walk's sick
She's a fly chick
Might hit


Man obama so I'll


He's makin history like x, King, and Douglas
And rfk Obama he s that new black knew that
Red neck said he won't beat john mccain
He don't wear a flag and his middle name's Hussein
But who gon' be that boy dat dat dat boy they call Obama
Got republicans sweatin like they up in saunas
Even Mccains 90 somethin' momma
He ready to pull his lever every hour
And I'd rather eat a field mouse
Than to see John Mccain in the White House
Vote Obama in and I promise you won't turn back
In to some uncle Tom-as
No Aunt Jemima or southern fried chicken
Call him cheif obama or Mr. Keeps on tickin
Man pass the riots comment couldn't pass his tally
Even Oprah Winfrey said that she was right behind him
People I say this country shol' holt without him
But he's gotta go out relate to every body
He do what he do like give his wife a hug then a fist dap
Gotta do that stuff in public so the hood know that he's black
Gotta use big words white people love to hear them
If they hear it they don't fear him they don't know him but they feel him
That's real

Hey, I take three l's to the head: Love, Live, Life, and I'm dead
Young Money, Dipset, that's what this is
And if I ain't good looking, you can bet my bitch is
I done made it off Apple Street like it was 2300 Jackson Street
Young Money, can't join 'em nor beat 'em
Where the fuck is Robin Leech when you need him?
A rich nigga can't even buy freedom
That's why I give my white bitches everything but freedom
I do my white bitches anything but beat 'em
And if they like rat poison, then I'ma feed 'em
I'm sophisticated, fresh from Antarctica my wrist just made it
I'm rich bitch, I ain't broke no more
But I will still chop you up and feed your ass to the poor
I'm 'bout my cream like a s'more
You old ass rappers better stay on tour
You're like 44, I got a 44, I'm 24
I could murk you and come home when I'm 44

T-Streetz
Mack Maine,
Jae Millz, uh
Tyga Tyga,


Drizzy Drake,
Nicki Minaj,
Hey Shanell
(Lloyd) and Young Lloyd
Ehhhh!!!


Check
Huh
What?
What?
Let's go, nigga (Where you at, Wheezy?)


You liable to catch me speedin' up the six, or beatin' up a chick
Or standin' over a stove, sweatin', heatin' up a brick
And we keep the hustlin' slick, and got clips like bananas
We twist the bandanas, and spit at niggas with cannons
We ran in habitats with masks and plastic gats
Stormin' through the house, screamin', "Where's this bastard's crack?!!"
I flash the Mack in front of your gal and make her tell
Like, "Slut! Where's the yay, or I'ma pop one in your grill!"
It's Lil Wayne, nigga - blast and bang triggas
Pay with my change, then I'm gon' have to bang niggas
I bag the caine quicker, and sprinkle like rain, nigga
Flood the av quick with the quarters and halves, nigga
If you out, you can find me on the street with the work
If it's a drought, you can find me on the street with the work
Never slip - I empty half a clip deep in your shirt
And put your whole clique deep in the dirt
Smell me?


(Hook-2x [Lil Wayne])
Who wan' beef with 'em?
Who wan' creep with 'em?
And when it comes down to guns, nigga, I sleep with 'em
See, we can sweep with 'em 'cause it get deep with 'em
And when it comes down to drugs, I'm on the streets with 'em


I'm the youngest Hot Boy on the field with heaters
Let my nine-millimeters kill your peoples
Bust up in your house and put the gun to lil' Renita
Give me the yay, or else I'ma put her in her sneakers
Wow (wow, wow) you can catch me in all black with no smile
Me, Turk, G'z and ouch - chicka-Pow!
How come these niggaz keep burnin the world
And why the hell this nigga Weezy keep firmin your girl?
Turnin the wheel on the orange and teal, Bentley drop
Then I'ma put that up and hop in the van and hit your block
Tell your mom to get the cops cause y'all gon' need 'em
When you see them bullets that my glock pop, y'all gon' eat 'em
See this for all my niggaz in the pen, I hope for freedom
And this for all my niggaz buyin bricks, I got 'em cheaper
Keep a nigga quiet as a mouse when I come
Wayne #1 Hot Boy, hot as the sun - ya smell me?




Nasty case, nigga run up in your crib, crash the place
Blast the face, automatic attach to waist
You bastards play?  Then it get awful and bad
There will be no more walkin for dad, and it's off with your head
A nigga either gon' get it right, or they get it at night
And when they spit it, lick his ass twice like 20 damn dice
Henny and ice is what I prefer but light on the rocks
I pack them clips tight on them glocks and light up your blocks
And if there's, coke involved then your throat's involved
I get the toaster and roll up and smoke most of y'all
Me and my nigga Super Sosa, run up in your crib
While your grandma watchin Oprah, jag her up and rope her
If you [?] chances slim like Ethiopia
If you want drugs, I got more flavors than Fruitopia
Recognize it's real and nuttin udder than that
Cause one from the mac'll have blood coverin your back, ha?




I'm the only one that get the job done
I don't know a nigga that can cover for me
Yeah, got some game from my days
So she might say she love me
She don't love me like she say she love me
Believe me, believe me
I'm that nigga, boy they love me in the streets
I'm not tryna find nobody else to beat
I'm the one they come to see because they all
Believe me


Yea, uh, rip, rip
It's been me and Young Tune off the rip
That's the man that put me in this shit
If a nigga fuck with him, I'll put him down quick
Got a verse for anybody wanna talk about the clique
I've been takin' shit light, you don't wanna hear me trip
God damn, do y'all really know who you fuckin' with?
Yeah, I mean you can't blame me for wonderin'
Doesn't matter, could be winter or the summer
On the road, I do One Direction numbers, I don't fuckin' miss
Yeah, Stunna and Mack know
When Wayne was gone for eight months, we put this thing up on our back
And I was snappin' off on every single track though
Collect call from the boss like where we at though
I was like, "Hah, it's our time, nigga"
He left Rikers in a Phantom, that's my nigga
And I've been rockin' with the team, Tha Carter ix
And we ymcmb, waitin' on somebody to try us, nigga
Yeah


I'm the only one that get the job done
I don't know a nigga that can cover for me
Yeah, got some game from my days
So she might say she love me
She don't love me like she say she love me
Believe me, believe me
I'm that nigga, boy they love me in the streets
I'm not tryna find nobody else to beat
I'm the one they come to see because they all
Believe me


Lord knows I'll murk one of these niggas, yeah
His and hers Ferraris, nigga
One for me, one for my daughter, nigga
Waitin' for someone to test me like a Harvard nigga
I tote a 223, two Michael Jordans, nigga
Come on, fight these shell cases like a lawyer, nigga
Find out where you stay, and act like we found some oil, nigga
Out of duct tape so when he prayin', I ignore the nigga
All I gotta say is sayonara, nigga
Drop dead gorgeous but the bitch ain't dyin' for a nigga
Where the real queens at? Shout out Capone and Noreaga
We can shoot it out and see who live to tell the story later
Diamonds in my Rollie face, cannot be exfoliated
They think I'm associated, I'm the one that orchestrated
Yayo get her ass whipped, whip that ass like horses racin'
Ain't 'bout what you walk away from, it's 'bout what you walk away with
Dead Presidents, them coffins vacant, I must be doin' somethin'


I'm the only one that get the job done
I don't know a nigga that can cover for me
Yeah, got some game from my days
So she might say she love me
She don't love me like she say she love me
Believe me, believe me
I'm that nigga, boy they love me in the streets
I'm not tryna find nobody else to beat
I'm the one they come to see because they all
Believe me


Had to get it poppin' off the rip
Rich young nigga that ain't never had to trick
Slim Thug flow but you know I like 'em thick
If she get a job at doa, I drop her off a tip
I had to get it poppin' off the rip
I'm the one they tell ya been reppin' in the 6
Come into the city and ya niggas get to trippin'?
We'll take ya to the Scarborough Bluff and drop you off a cliff
Well damn... Just be happy for the man
Nirvana, Coldplay nigga got bands
Ink from the money got it all over my hands
Goin' out to Houston spendin' all of my advance
V Live just took me for a cheque
“Drake you know I love you, you just took me outta debt”
Yes right now you are lookin' at the best
Mothafuck award shows and mothafuck the press like that!


Mothafuck the rest
When they jumped off the porch, I was stumblin' up the steps
I'd give what I collect before I give up my connect
It'd be a cold day in Hell, icicles made of sweat
One finger... Slidin' 'cross my neck
Niggas know what that mean like they deaf
Nigga I'll fire this nina like it's her first day
On the job and the bitch overslept
Tune stay humble, nigga I'm a king
Need a horn and a drumroll
They throw mothafuckin' roses at my feet, nigga
I don't step on one rose
I'm the only one that get the job done
I don't know a nigga that can cover for me
Tape a couple kilos to the bitch stomach
She look like she got a bun in the oven from me
Preheat... Believe me
All you gotta do is pay me every week
I had these bitches havin' babies every week
I'm the nigga, see me skatin' in the streets
Gone

(Verse 1 - Lil' Wayne)
It's Weezy baby, young and from the Dirty South
Get up your dope, I'm putting birdies out
Like thirty in my mouth, so I can say
Fuck you bitch you still ain't got a dirty mouth
The hood still ain't got over the drout
So you should sleep on your roof, just to watch over ya house
Nigga we tymin', the cost of my watch over ya house
I'm a boss man, I watch over the South
Jazze Pha, let's hop in the Lammy (Lamborghini)
Stop by Sammy, chill in the hood, you good, you family
My boys like to pull them blammies, and big pimp
Mami suck dick 'til she pull your hammy, homey
You know we only, keepin it gangsta
Deep in the Range, 17 in the chamber
All I need is my banger, nigga it's Weezy
This shit is over somebody cue me


(Chorus)


(Verse 2 - Lil' Wayne)
You don't wanna play wit me, I touch you man
Lose ya man in a tussle, but y'all don't see me
Y'all can't hear me, this a def jam, call me Russell, man
I played on Martin, call me hustle, man
And now y'all know I'm the yee-yo muscle, man
But on the under, I got that wonder, to stop that thunder
That rumble in the side of ya stomach, piled on water
How do you want it, come through in a Coupe powder blue or
High with water, how do you want it man
Ay, I towed a lot of tullies dun, I den broke a lot of hoopties dun
I den drove a lot of QP's from, here and there on the road
For the nigga gotta move his son, and I show you how to do this son
That's, that boy Weezy We, CMB, BITACH, and ya stunned


(Chorus)


(Lil' Wayne talking)


Bring the crowd and I'm loud in livin' color,
It is Weezy Fuckin' Baby got these rappers in my stomach, yummy,
I'm takin' it I ain't askin' 'em for nothin',
If you sell a million records we could battle for your money,
I'd rather count a hundred thousand dollars on a Sunday,
Watch a football game and bet it all on one play,
Still stuntin' baby yes I'm still flossin' latest car on the market with the top peeled off it,
Big wheels make it look a little bulky, you look a little salty have yourself a chilled coffee,
Chill out the girls is still out, even though I am a boss I got papers to fill out,
I'm busy I got paper to reel in, God I hope they steppin' at the end of my rod,
I hope I'm fishin' in the right pond,
And I hope you catchin' onto every line,
Who am I?

And you should be afraid, be very afraid, yeah!


The heart of New Orleans,
Thumpin' and beatin, living and breathin',
Stealin' and feedin', peelin' and leavin',
Killin' and grievin', dearly departed,
Erased deleted,
No prints no plates, no face no trace,
Out of sight out of mind, no court no case,
Sell his chains, celebrate


Block party, 2nd Lines, Zulu Ball,
Essence Fest, Jazz Fest, Mardi Gras
Shorty Bounce, Body Rock
Now he drop, now he got family
Try tell a Fed, tell a cop,
Smell a rat comin' back to the house to the spot
Tap-tap, knock-knock,
Who is that? (ch- ch- wop!)
Triggaman, Hoodieman,
Tell the kids Boogieman,
Pistol Pete, Ammo Mammal, Gunman, blum blam! Ha ha,
Damn Sammy you done fucked up,
Pussy ass niggas put ya nuts up,

You smell like a bunch of pussy to me, Fuck 'em!
Fuck 'em good, fuck 'em long, fuck 'em hard,
Fuck who? Fuck 'em all! (Yep)
Like that yeah just like that,
Right back I'm on that money train and that mack'll knock 'em off track,
The quarterback, well protected from the Warren Sapps,
The young heart attack, I spit that cardiac,
You can't see me baby boy you got that cataracts,
I'm right here straight out the hood just like an alley cat,
Since everyone's a king'll where the fuck your palace at,
Me I got callus on my hands, I can handle that,
It's no problem, baby I so got it,
It's just a victory lap, baby I'm just joggin',
Yeah, and I ain't even out of breath,
The muthafuckin' best yet, sorry for cussin',
Who?




D-D-D-Diesel on the beat
Shhhhhut up bitch... Let Anita speak!
I think on the remix of this song I'm a get uh, Common and Kanye
Yeah... Ok yeah


Anything you can do I could do better
I avoid trends and I'm still a trend setter
Weezy just let em, just let em die
I got all the answers so they call me when why
What where who, you think you fly?
I'm up there too - you fly, I flew
I'm up there too
You know they say two, is better than one, time
I'm, out there pimpin all the time
So keep your two cents before I give your ass a dime
Pistol on my waist gonna need a funeral and wait
Cause I'm a put that motherfucker dead in your face
R.I.P. I know my history
Run dmc but my girl is only worry bout one dmc
And I'm the shit like I-M-T-H-E-S-H-I-T, haha!


I do this!... When I want to
Nah really I can't control it
Even if I didn't wanna do it
I would do it! Hahahaha
Yeah...


Ready to battle anyone
I'm a go with God and a bag full of guns
Yeah I'm an animal hear me growl
You against me is like Man Vs. Wild
Me against you is like man versus child
Hehe and I am the man
It's Young Moolah, applaud my team
And we prefer red carpet if the floor's not clean
It's Mister, it's the microphone fiend
And they running with my words like I'm writing on jeans
Yeah, and if the lights could all scream
They'd sing my song, I like to be seen
I deserve to be heard if anything else
So I fear God and the world going deaf
Can you hear me now? Heh
Even the Hip-Hop vets tell me I'm the...


Scary!
Don't stop the beat Diesel
Cause I got the heat Diesel
Like diesel, yeah...


Heh I put it down like it's too heavy
But how can I with the world in my hands
Heaven in my plans
I swear I am important like the evidence I'm saying
I'm just trying to make my alphabets as heavy as I can
How do I live, when I'm as deadly as I am?
I get props and every other extra credit that I can
Cause see, I respect the merit of a fan
No homo but please blow me to Japan
Okay I'm getting hotter I'm a need another fan
I keep going so here I go again
Always trying to be better than I am
Label me the best and in the throne I will stand
Why? Because I'm just a stand up guy
Your hands smokin me cause I got your hands high
I'll probably be in the banga Ja Rule when "I Cry"
You only know me but God knows I try
No x-ray show my insides
And I gotta stay in touch with my pimp side
So, tell your girl I said what's up... I said hi...
She like that's what's up... Like the sky...
Byrd Gang taking off bitch watch em fly
And paint the sky red like the Crimson Tide
Flow retarded, Special Olympics kind
That gold medal heavy but it fit just fine
So, I just had to spit this rhyme
Spit like I'm trying to tongue kiss this rhyme
Some say greatness gets better with time
So I bought a zillion watches but don't watch mine
You little fucks are so I-ron-ical
Nickel plus fo' is a nine millimeter
No starch but I tote I-ron
All out in the open like I'm in I-ran
Young, champ-I-on, like a lamp I'm on
But um, I could clap and then lights off
Take no nights off but my days the same
And people change but fuck it nothing stays the same
And naw I ain't speaking so don't wave the blame
Lock me up but you could never cave the brain
Gasoline, can you invision if our gaze was flames
No you can not stop my vibe, couple page a game
Dang, a game? Yep, well gimme some crazy frames
And if this camera shoots me dead, Lord save my chains
Lord save the rings, I am way too vain hehe
Listen to that Kanye again
I play the game like I made the games
You playing like your trying to get traded mane
And you ain't gotta call me the greatest mane
But I am more of a dog than the greatest dane
You boys acting like ladies mane
Crying like you bout to have babies mane
And you can find me grinding on the days we playin'
And that's because I know the sun'll raise again
And when it do I'm a praise the mane
They say you crazy Wayne, but I just bake em mane
And that's Ms. Baker saying, that I'm the...


Hehe yeah
So, now I got...
I got the, I got the, I got the R&B; vets saying I'm the...
Hahahaha... Lil touchie bitch!

Grippin' grain and poppin' trunks, Dawg that ain't me
These elbows hit the scene back in '83

Just open up and let em rip, nothing new to a G
Hey, I ain't worried about these niggas, till they shoot at me

Still a busta ass rapper I'm refusing to be

You're a fool if you think,
There's another new, young rapper dude out there that's cooler than me
I choose in the V, brand new with the beat
I live real life like I say I do in the beat
Yeah, true indeed I do indeed
Do it for the O. G. S and the true mcs
Them bustas say this year I got brand new and it's all phat
But the fightin' in the club, I'm done with all that
Nigga, his ass out of line, then his ass gettin' whacked
Give a west-side 10 stacks and that's that

Same rules right now, I demand respect
If I slap one hoe, then her man's is next

A crack rock slingin muthafucka for a dollar
If you dare to be laid, then off in the acky
But if it ain't no way, then best believe I'm take it off a
A nigga with no hustle, it ain't work it yet
And a bitch like that is even worse than death
Out in the hood bullshittin' is what this game can cost him

Be a nerd, and they fuck nerds in jail I heard
As a nigga, I'm up in here with my balls and my word

Yo J. Are?, they've been waitin' for you dog. They've been asking.
You ready? Dipset, Lets go! Writer


To all my hustlers, rock smugglers, stugglers
Block bubblers, pushers, cookers pot jugglers
What's the word y'all, Flip that herb raw
Clap....... That's the bird-call


If the cops are comin, get to hop n runnin
Quick and drop that onion, ain't no stoppin youngin
Put away that herb raw, let us know the word whore
Clap........ That's the bird-call


I still be where the weed flip, and the peas with the trees lit
So much water in the order, it's just leaving them sea sick
But it's me in my V6, trying to skeet on her bead lips
They don't know, like I'm trying to keep her a secret
Act wrong, chrome, passin me dome
Next minute, shit I'm finished, she'll be flaggin it home
But I always keep a straggler, that's known to bone
And run through a lap, faster than marion jones
Man listen, I still got them grams flippin tan pitchen,
Corner to the damn kitchen
Gained a couple fans having made the transition
But I'm still in the hood like a transmission
No cat can match me, I'm passin fastly who half as nasty
I got it locked from here, all the way to cak-a-lacky
But keep a mac for scrapping, thinkin it's just laffy taffy
Shit this beat dun be the only thing clappin at me




Spokenyeah, I'm ready now)
Birdman Jr. And J. Are pigeons know who they are
Niggas gotta pay off
Snitches know to see yall
If chickens on the radar, I'm at it
'cause I get it on my day off, aint nuttin like getting weighed off
Scrape off the plates
Shake off the flakes
Dad daddy make all the kit kat
I gotta lay off the way ya'll hate me like I'm adolf,
But ya'll can't see me, Ray Charles
I steal whores
I'll probably take yours
Because you peel off and I take off
Give me no space whatever I want I takes,
Whatever I need I bleed and see
Bitch nigga don't breathe on the weed
I'm fucking with them birds
Without feeding them seeds that's creed you don't know about it,
Full clip how I go about it, full body,
Hard body, I'm like ya'll got it yet




Spokenkilla, dash, hoffa, you funny nigga.)
Damn, Homie
In high school you was the man homie
That's what a fan told me shiiiit
Same old cat, get his Kangol clapped
Brains blown back, this is dame, but dame don't rap
Shame on black, the game's so whack
Dame sunk some children
From in front of yo buildin straight to a hudred million
Bad pimpin pimpin, bad actin doggyy
Getcha limp on pimpin, if they actin froggy
Tell em back up off me, I come down clappin forty
Pow that's a badder story, not in my category
Mess around, dame held def jam down
Supporting my back, jackin and they left their pounds
Red-neck found, tech tech pound
Duck duck goose, pump pump shoot,
Shoot lets get down
It may seem petty,
But we all turn mean deadly
For green-fetti,
My whole team ready




This ain't only bars and tracks, this is for the hardest cats
Flippin all the harder back, make them catch a heart attack
When you see the narcs attack lemme know, start to clap, clap, clap
But start with he deals, your pa be on chill
The car is Deville, is real I'll
Heart in the grill it's far in my mills
Cruise the city with the semi or the celly
On skinnies like I'm starving my wheels

I jocked the way she rocked her lil Versasce and her Prada

I popped up by her mamas so her nigga wont know nada
She took thirty minutes play me like a some kinda coward
Now hopped up in my car and started talkin bout her doctor
She said she started ridin it in her babys fathers Honda
She wish that he would trade it in and cop a brand new Mazda
I'm drivin to the (??) to the back and put the top up

There was this stoofy name was Lucy came up to me at the movies
Said she just saw Balla Blockin and thought that I was cute
And but you and baby too can still come over early Tuesday
I just bought a new mansion just finished it and my movie

And me I'm Iceburg Tom and Jerry Darryl Goofy
She say "oo" it would be so nice and usually she would do it
But lately she been (?? ??) just came from institution
I say that's cool 'cause I don't really wanna have to shoot him
I gave the braud the pager number and said that she should use it
As soon as I flew by in that navy and baby blue six
She beeped and left a message that she come up with a solution
I scootin a run through straight to my house I wont be foolish
She had no bathin suit and then want me to see her booty
I oozed it in her coochie when she got in my Ja'causezi.
She asked me for a kiss  ah...

(feat. Juelz Santana)


Now this is what they've been waiting for
Ya dig, Santana
Weezy F.
Ay Wayne
What up man
What you been workin' on nigga?
Oh you know, I got Currency's new album
And I'm finally workin' on my album, ya dig
Oh I'm ready to brush my shoulders off and drop my next album too nigga
That's what it is
But dig this, they wanna know what we been workin' on together
That's that "I Can't Feel My Face Shit" they know what
So if they ever thought the South and the North was gonna collide
Guess what, we already did


I'm feelin' like a black Republican
Naw, I can't call it
More like a black Democrat runnin' 'em out of office
Young Barack Obama, I'm all for it
The Rock of Gibraltar has now fallen, on ya
I protect my land like a farmer
Pockets stay chubby like Tikara
Or should I say fat like the Parkers
Tote big guns like I'm still playin' Contra
Y'all washed up like money that's laundered
Y'all funny, I'm bonkers
Honest, girls strapped to my dick like a harness
Rock star, flier than an ostrich
And I cover east, west, north, south like a compass
I shall shine forever, never tarnish
Money buried behind my house like a garden
All green, my bank account's like a forest
I Can't Feel My Face is gettin' started
And Weezy is my accomplice, ya dig
A black activist like Sonny Carson
Stripes of a sergeant, salute me
And chicks, I get 'em high
Higher than turbulence is
White Phantom, lookin' so Fergielicious
I'm from the city of big drugs and murder victims
It's get rich, go to jail and be a murder victim
Ai!
Now all y'all listen
If you can't take the heat, get out the kitchen


I feel like a black Republican
Tote a mac in the public and
Act so southern n' die for my brethren
Money, money, money
Like money Mac and publishing
One life to live, never ask for a mulligan
Streets cold but the heat make me feel covered in em
Been done had cake day late like Ed Sullivan
Fly like an eagle but no I'm no Donovan
Boy you better go eat some soup with your mom n' them
And my mind is on another continent
I am real Cash Money, no counterfeit
I don't parkin' lot pimp I just politick
Bet I get all in her mouth like polident
New Orleans representa to the inner
Come from the city where the glitter don't glimmer
The sun don't shine and the guns don't sleep
Wake a nigga's ass up like he got somewhere to be




I'm feelin like a black republican drug money comin in
I'm a volcano filled with lava bout to erupt again
I stay with the iron don't make me plug it in
Stay outta rich kid's business don't be buttin in
I stay with a chick that's ready to unbutton it
Forget her tongue she put her lung on it ha
My listerine comes out she start guzzerin
I'm above you dudes I'm hoverin
Juelz why you duckin them duckin who?
I'm in the hood like what it do comfortable
And believe me it's nothin to
Send my london boys to english muffin you
You poodles barkin too much they bringin muzzles through
You aint gully you gullible
Man they need love, they need hugs,
They need church, Jesus
This is jus a sample yea a free drug
The shipment is in, we done re-d up
But I don't trust dudes like a pre-nup
They cockaroaches, they gotta be bug
Maybe cause they them
And we us and we up
I'm ballin fareal ya gotta d-up
I don't hear you boys speak up
What are you guys sayin [?]
I have the chaufeur hold the umbrella over my head when it's not rainin


And we wanna let the world know
This is not a diss song either people
We don't diss them we dismiss 'em, ya dig
Recognize or step aside, ya dig
We let the music talk, Draught 3
And by the way, it's Santana, I'm back
It's Weezy!
You dudes gotta stand in the mirror backwards 'cause you can't face yourself
Assholes
Dipset for life

Still on these hoes like a mack in a suit
Still on my toes not a crack in my shoe
Rappers talkin about me but I don't give a hoot
These niggas still lyin I'm the muthafukin truth
Talk tough till I knock off your kuff
And I own my team, I'm like a Maloof
They hatin on me I'm just tryin to be weezy
Just like young jeezy in lambobingghini
Smoked out my mind baby and now I'm seein threebies
Dope boy fresh from my fitted to my dc
All red so these hoes know who we be
We B's Bloods we B's
Pop pop flow yea ya'll niggas sweet peas
Gettin high on a yacht call it see me




Yea, I advance my flow and they must like that
They like it so much, they say they wright that
Barkin at the dog, but I don't bite back

Bad cpr bad bitch on a bite back
Skittles on my wrist, yea nigga the bright pack
Ima shine, I live witha light hat

Brand new coupe same color as the sky
The dash same too, lord know I'm gon try
Cop pull me over lord know I'm gon lie
They go up in my trunk lord know I'm gon fry
Them niggas throwin salt all over my fries
So ima just walk all over them guys
Niggas throwin darts never hit the bullseye
Young money bitch new orleans east side




Yea, been around the world rep the same thang
Been around the world it's the same gang
B's up B's up flame gang braa braa braaa braaa bang bang
I tol my homie streets can't sleep on life
So he popped the X pill and didn't sleep all night
I aint worried bout you I'm just tryin do me
Last album did 2 I'm just tryin do 3
I am what every pair of eyes oughta see
Bitches just wish they could call a art of me
My momma used to tell me just get a 9 to 5
Cash money made her say never mind I'm fine
(B's up!)




The streets make the hustlas
Hustlas make the world go round
The world is made of keys, ounces and pounds
The keys, ounces and pounds is made from hustlas
See how shit come back round for ya
Gotta cop it, chop it and cook it
See how shit come back round for ya
Gotta kick in the oven now watch it bubble
And you can knock on my door
But you can't knock the hustle
But I- it's like a game of twenty-one and I got nineteen
And my Jake but I put more 'd' on me
Lil Weezy Wee gon eat that's how it is
Got insurance on the floor man I'm that positive
And I'm shaggy in the saggy lens
Me an my squad in the paddy wagon tally Benz
And you know I put the mags on that
. 45 mack with the flash on that
Who want it
Everybody sing along


Now I'ma ride cuz I got riding in my bloodline
And I'ma shine cuz I got shining in my bloodline
I get that dough cuz I got hustle in my bloodline
I bleed concrete


And when I move, I move out with the raw
I move out with the squad
To his album we ride we so mob
I throw lives and lowest to live
For my loaf of bread the people's player
I did what the culture said
And I live by the coast of Nostre Cid
Fuck around I'll knock your shoulder from your head
Get it right I'm a soldier till I'm dead
This kid is white with buttonholes inside that bled
I'm pumping o's with lots of hay
I'm so high and really I don't even know why
And oh I just go buy a whole house
And lay my mat down lay her back down
But I never put my mack down
You see the thug in me
You know Weezy he the young son of Bubba-B
Buy my basketball shorts with a thunder B
If you want it then come to me
I'm right here




I'm G'd up
Only follow the code of the streets
Live bad to die good
Know how to move when hustling by the days with no food
But just so I can eat
And ain't it a bitch
And if you see me getting fat I'm probably getting rich
And you probably can see me for some crack before six
And after that it's all bricks
A fake and my palm is wrapped around this eight
And my arm because the dirty south is straight Vietnam
I skate with the bomb
I'm asking you don't play with me at all
Shots hit your ass and make three of y'all
It'll take three of y'all to fill one of my shoeprints
Cuz I did and do shit that's better than new shit
Fit for two clips
The kid is a nuisance
Awww man, he's inspired by his own gangsta music
And the Blueprint
Cruising through stoop with the ewe lit
Like ooh shit this is more than weed, it's 500 Degreez




I live it up like these are my last days
If time is money, I'm an hour past paid
Ughh, gunpowder in my hourglass
Niggas faker than some flour in a powder bag
Yeah, I put it down like my hands hurting
I'm on a natural high, but I land perfect
Some of us are lovers, most of y'all haters
But I put up a wall, and they just wallpaper
So love or hate me, I stay hate-free
They say we learn from mistakes, that's why they mistake me
I got some weight on my shoulders, to me it's like feathers
All hail Weezy, call it bad weather
I stick to the script, I memorize the lines cause
Life is a movie that I've seen too many times
You're on the outside looking in, close the blinds
And they say never say never, but fuck your nevermind
I've been gone too long
True or false, right or wrong
Hello Weezy, welcome home

I do it for the money, man I am such a hooker
And freedom was my girl, until they fucking took her
You can look into the future, it's right behind your eyelids
But I don't wanna know, cuz shit I like surprises
Why that, why this, why you on that why shit?
Motherfucka ask me why, I say ym
Beach bum, call me ocean drive slim
Drop the top, look up and make the sky grin
Young moola, skinnies and some supras
Belly of the beast till it pukes
Motherfucker


Blunt blowin'
Polo draws showin'
I don't give a lovely Motherfuck ass nigga
With my teeth glowing, I'm on my Deebowin'
You don't need a bus pass, for me to bust yo ass nigga


Blunt blowin'
Polo draws showin'
I don't give a lovely Motherfuck ass nigga
With my money blowing, no matter where you going
You don't need a bus pass, for me to bust yo ass nigga


I've been gone too long
True or false, right or wrong
Hello Weezy, welcome home
It's young mula, baby
Young mula, baby
I've been gone to long
True or false, right or wrong
Hello Weezy, Welcome home
Yeeea


Lil' wayne lyrics


"BM J.R."


Yea shorty, you know what I'm talkin bout'
I peep these niggaz out here they slippin like they ain't bout
Money no more man, so what fuck
You know what we gon' do ha?
We gon' do what we been doin nigga
We gon' load up, get a lot mo' and a lot mo' and say fuck em'
Nigga
Keep fuckin hoes
Loadin up on mo' bitches
Then you know what I'm sayin, we gon' get greedy too nigga
I ain't never gettin' full, I'm full blooded with this grind
I got it


Murder capital, only key to survive is kill
If the elements don't murder you the riders will for real
And niggas know I goes hard to the fullest
Get involved and I got' em' playing dodge ball with bullets
Yeah
I got the sawed off, fully in the sean john hoody
Get fucked ya play pussy
We hit em' up while they ain't lookin and them body shots hurt
And the head shots took him
Damn
And if the read dot spot him then the hollow head got him
Knock his top to his bottom jack
You see me grind from the bottom just to make it to the bottom
At the very bottom of the map
Lou-easy-ana pirahnnas everywhere you at
You gotta wear an extra condom and an extra gat
Yo bitch could get it for actin like a man
Them niggaz in Pakistan impactin on ya man
I back his hand ya man on command
In front of niggaz he cool with the boys on fan
I'm on hot, I adjust in different climates, duckin the animal keep on runnin wit
My primates
You ain't did it till you done it like in 5 states,
Weezy hustle no blubber I put on weight
And in a drought I go on I diet and stretch more
Loose all that weight, leave a nigga with stretch marks
You don't even come up to a nigga chest part, subpar,
What the fuck they play it in the club for?
Real shit I'm duckin bombs from a drug war,
No religion but the cops swear that I'm a drug lord
Father forgive em' for they know not who they pushin lord
Father forgive me if I have to send them to ya lord
I'm just tryin to dodge the shots they send to the god
They riding up highway to heaven boulevard
Damn, them niggaz pussy and jive, not even in an eye exam they ain't lookin for "I"
The A and the K will make ya face crook to the side
Now when you smiling everybody gotta look from the side
'cause when you wildin you ain't lookin, you just lookin high
And when we hungry you look like pie
Sweet potato ass nigga, you lemon merangue, apple custard, cherry jelly
Don't make me get the biscut buster
What up gizzle you my distant brother
Real shit nigga same father different mother, yep
I skip the frontin and sticks to keepin it trill
You not know me for nothing other I'm something other them people you feel, I'm deeper for real
I'm deeper than skills, my speeches can kill
Rest in peace


Yeah, you underdig, shorty it's all about one thing nigga,
If you bout money nigga come fuck with us,
If you ain't bout money get the fuck from round us nigga
And whatever you bout we bout it, however you wanna get it we can give it to ya
Order bitch, ya underdig
Put ya prints in nigga
Put ya feet down and ya nuts on the concrete and lets roll


Ay, ay
You sleep in a field for tryin the dude
I bust ya head to the meat, turn ya mind to food
Food, cruelful thought, think I ain't lying to you
I lie his body in grease set fire to him
I tie his body in sheets, put the tires to him
Make him feel the escalade, put his feet in the blades
Damn
I'm the heat in the blaze a nigga keep they ways when I'm in the streets with blades
Watch, my nigga hungry, he'll eat the plate
And if I ask, the homeboy will eat'cha face
Yea
And though he got me, you can ask, I'm like a pool table
I keep the eight
Haha
My side pocket sideways when I pop it leave a nigga sideways for five days
Birdman talk to em'


Yeah nigga, I tell em', I tell em' again shorty
If it ain't about money get all the fuck from round us


Ay, ay,
Check my swag, I travel like sound dawg
You play hard in the gravel like ground dog
I'm underground call me groundhog
Lay down laws call me ground law
Don't confuse me with the law, naw but just confuse me with my pa
Because I am the Birdman J-are
I ain't trippin nigga, I play the corner like ripkin nigga
With the 40 cal ripkin nigga, rip a nigga
Flip ya vehicle, split ya windshield
Whack ya Baby momma but I let the kid live
And people say that I am a kid still, 'cause the lil nigga still ride on big wheels
You feeling animal then come on and get killed
And sig pill bandannas like banana's
Say I'm slight bananas I blew a weekend in havana
In my cabana with my bottom bitch from savahnna
Man a train couldn't stop ya man
I man up and you not a man
I stand up, say I got my land
I'm the man of my land
Call it lil-weezy-ana
That's the new plan


Yeah nigga, you bout some money get at me nigga
That's the only way
Dumb shit we bout that get at me
Nigga roll solo, dolo nigga

All white diamonds on the front of my teeth
And you better put the O in front of my G
The bullshit they talkin doesn't come to my knee

My two best friends will accompany me
And right now they are in my dungarees sleep
One name Mack one name Nina
They hit ya make ya do the macarena
Where ya tools

And I'm so New Orleans it's like a motherfucker
It's young money and we eattin get ya own supper
Make me go off to the trunk and get da bonecrusher

But before she start singin she gotta check my mic
Niggas just hatin and I done lost sight

(Lil Wayne talking)
We have them bitches like it was unplugged

We have them bitches like it was unplugged
Weezy, Fresh, and Unplugged


Verse 1:
(Lil Wayne)
Give me a big fine bitch in a dress
One put them lips in effect
Suck the dick 'til the shit in her chest
You can piss on her brest
I like that shit
Project hoes like that dick, Don't bite that dick
Give me a Spanish sweet hoe
Black from Puerto Rico
Freak ho, Specialize in givin' me deep throat
Really don't care how short how plump, short or thick
Give me head, Don't care, Swallow c** don't spit
Aww shit, I like them Jamicians and them Hatians
Niggas can't take it when they shake an make me rape 'em
White girl's I video tape 'em and they enjoy it
They love it when everybody saw it
Its off tha chain
High yellow Mexican bitches they all for brain
But watch them hoes who want the change
Its not a game
Or short cuban hoe, With a fat ass though
An I'll keep the bitch just like Fidel Castro


Chorus:
(Unplugged)
Tell me what you like
Let me tell you what I like
You goin' on an breakin' me off by the end of the night
You can ride with me
Cause I like ya Simmon's jeans
Ain't tryin' to make a love scene
Truly I just want you to break me off


Verse 2:
(Lil Wanye)
Weezy the hottest
Drinkin' Barcadi
I stream through the scene on a Lincon on Robbers
Lookin' for the finest dime, To wine and dine
Later on I'm tryin' to climb behind ya spine
Hold up lil mama, Slow ya ass down
Pick it up, Throw ya ass down
Now throw ya ass around
An scream me name
I can't hear you say it louder what (Wayne, Wayne)
A damn shame
Better watch that boy he nasty
I strap on a plastic
Break ya off like elastic
Put the dick in the middle, Make it wiggle for ya'll
Might be small, But that dick ain't little at all
I like a short thick broad, Fat ass an shit
Like Taso flip like Trina The Baddest bitch
Matter of fact when I see her, Pull her Over like a cop
Juve coulda Backed It Up an I woulda Dropped It Like it's Hot
Ha Ha, Ya heard me
Ha Ha, Unplugged




Verse 3:
(Mannie Fresh)
I like them big, round, yellow and brown
A bitch that take it from the back and make the (Ugh Ugh) sound
Now you can bounce, slide, drop, giddy up, giddy up
Now you can ride til you feel it hit a nut, hit a nut
Bounce for ya hood, Shake for ya baby daddy
Twerk for that nigga who got you pregnant in the Caddy
Slide with the ky, Hold up???
My bitch got thong, You bitch got drawls
My chick like to swallow, Yo chick like to spit
If yo chick was my chick I'd still love that bitch
Hold up, Chill out, Wait a minute stop
My Ginseng, Viagra, and a Strawberry pop
See I'm feelin' kinda bold, Why don't ya bring a friend
From vigina to the asshole do it again
I want a yucky down misses bout whatever
Yo mama loved a Tymer, Now you welcome
You ok Lil mama and I love that chick
But deep down inside I just love me dick


(Chorus 4x)


Nice tires on da ghini, 
You should wanna king me
Brain dead flow, vegetable zukini
I live on the beach, 
She walk around in her bikini
Girls are like a school, 
And cut em like seniors
I'm here to distinguish, 
The bears from the penguins
Life is such a gap, 
Get some money in between it
Glocs like police, 
Pumps like fenas
This beat gettin totaled, 
Pam, Keisha, Kema
Sittin on da World, 
Thinkin bout a girl
Pistol on my side, 
Paint you like mural
Dig in my pocket, 
Pulled out the party
Be cool before you get stumped and pulled out the party
Ha Ha Hollygrove shit, I'm on my Hollygrove shit
Lookin for a bad bitch, I give her dinosaur dick
Big bad flow Weezy, fuck the polices
Church like a choir and a couple of old priests
Elevator in my crib cause it's five floors
I'm not expectin you to have one inside yours hahe
Vince Young, suicide doors, haha, 
Life's a bitch, now die for her.


I have the type of flow n-ggas don't have to like, 
My rhymes is ambidextrous so I don't have to write, 
The way I'm eating n-ggas wish they had my appetite, 
Straight up out of Texas and I'm major like apple white, 
I pull four then I hit the exit door, 
Take a trip to Macy's cop the whole second floor, 
Hood smell the scent of money coming out my pours, 
Yeah my pockets full of dead people like a morgue, bore, 
I made it from a flyer to the forbes, (see me)
Young Elvis Freshly, yes he flyer than the store, 
Dropping babys out and your chicks cheek, kicks neat, 
Got your son looking up to me like I'm 6 feet, 
Your daughter need someone to save her, not me, 
I knocking hoes down like Laila Ali, 
Try he and imma put the toaster to ya kidney, 
Then I pull off in a Bentley top open like a chimney, 
Damn, it's no ceilings like a Colosseum, 
Candy slab, paint dripping like gonorrhea, 
The way I'm leaning I'm annoyed if I stand still, 
Flow harder than an anvil, 
Short (short)


Ok, it's Gudda hoe, 
All about my bills like buffalo, 
Your b-tch under my sheets, 
I heard she was an undercover hoe, 
Purple got me moving slow, 
Like I'm in a snail race, 
Pop pop pop 3 shots to the head, 
Then I pick up my shell case, 
Leave em with a pale face, 
Yes, I am a young money goon, 
Your girl like a motion picture she be coming soon, 
I do a certain rule, I pop her like balloons, 
I dance her of to Mills and drop her off the tune, 
Couple screws lose, wanna play with him, 
This is No Ceilings b-tch, ruthless like a stadium, 
We shut down every f-cking spot these b-tches see us in, 
You want us club, well n-gga pay us then, 
All grey BM, I'm getting from my baby M, 
She told us get the money and count it for me when I rake it in, 
Don't play no games hoe, 
You know my name hoe, 
G-U-D-D-A propane flow


(feat. Little Brother)


Hey baby look here, I got this new song I wrote, it's got that nice slow groove that everybody dancin' to, and when I play it, it kinda remind me of me and you. I mean, there's one more thing I want to talk about. It's time for you to come home, everybody got their problems I'm dealing with mine. I done gave up them narcotics, I'm a changed man.


She loves me, she loves me not.


How many ways can I say I'm done fishin'.
You wanted the role, smash the audition.
Havin' a partner for a man in my position eliminates the cooks in the kitchen.
Still I got a taste for that fast food, foreign cars, many women.
And some say it's the life I was given.
I say it don't matter if I work at Mc-E-D's.
I still got a fix for what you got between ya knees.
On a new broad, you still one to one.
Every once in again I like havin' some fun.
No disrespect intended but what's done is done.
Women steppin' out for love, men do what to come.
Not a playa like Pun, but when shorties get the grabbin' on me.
The last thought I get is Koobie run.
To them girls wishin' on a star that's will stun.
But I gotta tell it like it is hun, one.


She say she love me, won't leave me, won't ever let me go.
But if you're thinkin' of leaving you need to let me know.
We better together then further apart, so darlin' don't go breakin' my heart.


We was high school sweethearts, talkin' since we was teens.
Every morning, and every evening.
Ten years later she eatin' that mean cuisine.
I'm on the field, straight gone of that creatine.
In the nfl which mean Not For Long.
City to city, all the groupies they hop along.
Word get back to wifey, she like "Stop the song,"
I'm takin' the kids to my mommas, I'm out, I'm gone.
Momma was like Baby now I hate to see your tears.
But I've been with your daddy for 'bout 35 years.
And in my day I had to turn a blind eye to cheating.
But I ain't never had to wear no black eye from beatings.
As long as he doing right, by you and your kids.
How you gon' expect that man not to be who he is.
I ain't sayin' that it's right but we often pay the price.
Cause a womens life is love, a mans love is life.
And he gon' live it to the fullest, and I ain't tryna pull you down or sound like a broken record.
But you should know by now that all niggas is dogs.
Better to have a rich pit then a broke german shepard.


She say she love me, won't leave me, won't ever let me go.
But if you're thinkin' of leaving you need to let me know.
We better together then further apart, so darlin' don't go breakin' my heart.


I say I don't have nothin' if I don't have you.
Like Shadai, we got the sweetest taboo.
And my game is skin deep, like your first tattoo.
I gets all in ya head just like shampoo.
I just wanna fuck with you like rude polices.
I don't want a broken heart because I lose the pieces.
Hey, girl don't play with my gangsta.
And have the boy blue like a Texas Ranger.
And I know cheaters never get crowned.
So I play "fair" like roller coasters and clowns.
You gotta hold ya soldier down.
Even when the war is lookin' it is right around the corner.
And you don't want to leave me, believe me.

Bein'-a half-way out my nappy head
But I don't care - I just grab my clip, slap and spray
Anywhere - it don't matter where a nigga stay
Just believe me when I say, "Guerrilla warfare"
I swear, it be some more drama about these bags
Niggas in black drive Jags - camouflage rags
Niggas' domes get bust wide open with blood and sweat
Niggas ridin' off in Hummers - laughin', drinkin' Moette
You know me: Colleon, standin' four feet
I'm to-tin' cannons, wearin' Rolies
See, these lil' boys, they ain't really up on my game
But once I run into that nigga playin' with Wayne, man
See, when I spin-a you bend then I be on you block
But when me jump out with the chop-chop, my nogga, you drop
Now where your niggas at, comradie? They not with you now
I guess they heard that when I'm ridin' I make the crew stop
Now, is you 'bout what I'm 'bout?
If you 'bout what I'm 'bout, you 'bout drama
Thuggin' in broad day with four glocks, a knife, and a chopper

Give me that rag, you ain't no soldier - wipe the blood off my chain
Gettin' blisty...

'Bout to do the old usual - hit your block, just spittin'
Heads spinnin' like a set of seventeens or somethin'
Respect me for who I be: seventeen, head-bustin'
Because-


(-Hook [Lil' Wayne])


Check!
Original Hot Boy - land-cruisin' with guns
I shall be the one who burn the block up
Never miss when I distribute anger up out my Cali'
Hundred shots automatic
Leave ya hopeless in the alley
Now, when a nigga runs up
If the nigga loveless (like me) would have his guns up
Just because of the simple fact that I'm a Hot Boy,...
... And got boys that got toys to stop noise
See, when me ride off in the Hummer, leave him set empty
Now him catch three 'cause him want beef
Now, me tried to tell the stupid boy, "Don't mess-a with me."
Now look at him - open up his casket and see
Click-clack my mack, twist my Philly cap to the back
Jump in the black and scream "war", and just "pow! pow!"
How you love me now?  With five barrels to your eye
The scene gets wild, and everybody gon' die
What the dillio? Fill a four-four clip
You'll get flipped for runnin' off at the lip
Who behind the gun slang,...
... Blood hang,...
... And twistin'?
It's Mis-ter Wayne
Come splittin' when I spit

I said who's that peeking in my window
Is that sunshine, is that one time
Let that sunshine through my living room
Hospitality is what I'm giving you
Harsh reality is what I've been through
But I'm not alone, ask her and him too
And they sure tell ya even better then the smell of a new day
And I know the ocean runs dry and the sky get dark
Then you don't see what he's trying to show ya
And I know the wall will seem tall but if we help eachother I guarantee we get over
And once I'm over, I'll reach back for my brother and pull him over aswell
Keep our heads high and our noses wide open
Hoping for that new day smell
Love live life

Tha Carter gon' be late so I cooked up a tape
The garden's full of snakes so I had to escape
Lil homie gon' be straight, lil' homie gon' be straight


This that Sorry 4 The Wait 2
And I'm sorry for the wait too
I told myself to save yourself cause I can't save you
I send my goons to kill somebody, I need head proof
Fuck, this that Sorry 4 The Wait 2
I ain't trippin', I got Barbie, I got Drake too
I send my goons to kill somebody, I need head proof
Then they come through and sit it on my coffee table


Who kept this shit together? Nigga, me, that's who
Who was there when niggas left? Nigga, me, that's who
Cash Money is an army, I'm a one man army
And if them niggas comin' for me, I'm goin' out like Tony
Now I don't want no problems, I just want my money
Ain't gotta hold no conversation or my luggage
Tell whoever's countin' that I'm on a hundred
Birdman Jr., more like Ugly Duckling


Takin' over, now I'm takin' over
Think it's over? Bitch I'm thinkin' forward
I'm sippin' lean out a glass, nigga
All I got is Young Money, no more Cash, nigga


And this that Sorry 4 The Wait 2
No longer am I my brother's keeper, Cain and Abel
Young Money sharp, I'm still eatin', I just chipped my tooth
Tell them niggas no love lost cause I ain't got shit to lose
I told myself to save yourself cause I can't save you
I send my goons to kill somebody, I need head proof
I found a needle in a haystack, put the thread through
I tried to stitch the wound back up but I just bled through


It's compensation over conversation
Lord I must got blurry vision, a nigga's got two faces
Lord, this game is a vampire
But you gotta protect your neck, it'll suck you dry like raisins, lord
But fuck that, nigga
Gun drawn out, fuck that, nigga, I'ma ball out
The day you met me is when Hell froze
On the day I left is when it thawed out
I'm still in the buildin', I just have to knock a couple walls down
Have to kick y'all out
Life is a movie but sometimes a nigga get too tired of watchin' and walk out


Takin' over, now I'm takin' over
Dropped the Sorry 4 The Wait until the wait is over
Sippin' lean out a flask, nigga
And all I do is smoke, fuckin' thrash, nigga


And this the Sorry 4 The Wait 2
Fuck these haters, throw your board up if you skate too
I send my goons to kill somebody, I need head proof
Then they come through and sit it on my coffee table
Tunechi, niggas don't appreciate you
You've been down since day 1, it meant nothin' on take 2
Sometimes the truth is hard to swallow and to say too
But I graduated from that bullshit, now I hate school


And now I'm takin' over, now I'm takin' over
Old me dead and gone, that's who I'm prayin' over
Might have to go back to slangin' yola 'til the wait is over
If so then I got bakin' soda, I got bakin' soda


Ok now shawty hair yellow
Shawty eyes brown
Shawto so gold
And so is my crown
Baby color make me bad
Shawty coat red
And so is my flag
Purple in my bag
And shawty hair black
And so is that car that I got in my back
How did I go wrong with my girl in fact

Since the president black
I went and bought her black pearls

She just wana wana fly up the waynebow
And I'm gonna let her
Cause me and her colors create art together, ooh!

En belle au france I do when we smoke the ooey

Come over here and maybe you can get a few sheets
My bodies unique like the sistine chapel
Fresh (fresh) 6 spring apples
I should cut myself to see if my bloods red
Baby I brainstorm call me flood head
Married to the money
And if she leaves me bury me money
And when your not good then your arrogance is funny
And when your really rich then asparagus is yummy

Cause under them sheets I am a mess
Yes, baby you blessed
Not chess don't jump ya ness


Babyface // Hook
I'm not saying this to shake you up
I'm just saying this to wake you up
It's all good when we making love
All I ask is don't take our love
For granted, it's granted
My love for you, is real
If you don't love me
Somebody else will, so baby girl
Don't you ever get too comfortable


Lil Wayne // Verse 3
Yeah, it's no sweat no sweat
I will never 1, 2, 3 4-get
About you, your love, your s**
You know I work you out like bowflex
Our jokes. No stress. Love.
Live life. Proceed. Progress.
Make sure the neighbors get no rest
We can get together, never disconnect
Your back, your neck
Funny how that song hasen't got old yet - to us.
So let's project, you stay in
Never in - correkt

But I wouldnt touch
But it wasnt because I didn't know enough
Shit.. I jus knew too much
So I stop bein lazy, and I became creative
And I learned how to create it
And all dat pots for me!!!
So come see... Or come eat

No red lights inside, jus a bare room wit green lights ummm mmm

Haahaaa that's ur hoe my guns of water help your garden grow... No


Yeah I know dat wuz crazy
But I think you are more crazy.. Yer
Than her
Cuz she is no daisy
Shit she jus pottery
Wit no seeds
So she can't eat


My heroes had da broads and da cars wit big ol' rims
And I could remember slangin, thinkin
I wanna be like them
Ever since I was little, ever since I was little
I lived life numb


It made so much since for me to run
When da 5-0 come
Cuz I aint dumb umm mmm


And dat shit I hated
Like early 90s late 80s
I wuz husltin as a baby
You can ask eagle street, about me

Cuz it made no sense where I wuz from hmmm
To walk around wit none
Shit, nicca you would be crazy
Cuz niccas is crazy
And I'm a 80s baby
You should be proud of me

But she just say baby, she jus calls me baby
She jus screams out baby, when she's on top of me
And da sheets be stickin like pages
And da bed is so stanky
If she say dat is my baby, shit it is prossibly not for me
M.-O.-E.

And I can't help but think that I knew you first
It's getting louder
Girl I can't ignore it no more baby

And you don't have to cry no more (you don't have to cry)

For them dead presidents we will start digging graves
I swear my momma trust my work, so I give these hoes that work
They say the best things in life are free, that's why it cost for you to get get murked
And my pants saggin like fuck it I'm still on my business
Spent my birthday in jail, I was making bad decisions
Saw my enemy at the light, shot him up before it turned green

Your bitch ride me like a go kart
I play that pussy like Mozart

I like em long haired and curvy
And if niggas think it's a game, I'll leave their brains on their jerseys


She say she love me, that's the molly talking
Her pussy so wet it keep sliding off it
She got a nigga but he ain't me bitch
I'm the original gangster, he the remix
Girl, do you use that same mouth to kiss yo momma?
I say, only God can judge me, fuck your honor
And her birthday suit is her pajamas
She say, I didn't know your dick was a recliner
I'll punch your man in his eye, give him a shiner
I'll blind him, him and whoever cosign him
I get Adam like Yolonda
Young Money Cash Money's Obama
It's fuck the world, no condom
If he twisted, I'll unwind him
And this pistol came with a silence


But I swear to God he heard it! 
Yea, and I swear to God I ain't nervous
Na, I swear to God I ain't nervous
Bitch I'm the God, I should be rapping in a turban
Ain't got no problems in this bitch and that's for certain

Game tight like virgins

Call her AK when she's squirting
You see the niggas I'm with, that boy Boo the shit
As long as I got a face, yo bitch got a place to sit
Yea, I'm wilding off them shroomies
Ain't got no worries like Tunechi
All my chicks be boogey, wanna hold hands then watch movies
I be goddamned, make a nigga lose it
Ain't no talking- lets get to it
Real niggas winning, fake niggas losing

Girl, I swear to God I ain't nervous

My serpent
Ain't got no problems in this bitch and that's for certain
You fuck with Tunechi, you'll end up a Missing Person
She got Lil Tunechi on her booty, in cursive
I'm getting head behind the Maybach curtains
Ya


Damn, Damn girl you know you got it going on,
You can see by the way that she walking
You so fine that your body need a body guard,
Well I can be your hubby,
Ohh your only tenderhonnie
Let me beam you up like Scottie,
I got Whitney so just enough for everybody in this party, girl
Da Da da da da
Da da da da da
(Repeated)


I know you want me,
Yeh, give me that monkey,
Yeh, that funky monkey,
Yeh (that funky monkey)
Bass


Da Da da da da
Da da da da da
(Repeated)


Yep, I'm in like flea, Benjamin Frankalin my twin
Yah, If she can't swim, I gotcha girl sinkin in my Benz.
Backstroke, backstroke, Like Michael Phelps with my backstroke.
Break her off till her back broke, I leave her numb like crack folk.
Then I get to the money, Monday through Sunday. Anxiously like Honey Dew honey.
Menage A watch Honey do Honey and den they do me and I'm glad they done it.
Yah. I'm wit D-are-E the n-gga that make beats wit that n-gga C-O-O-L. Cool.
We so mother f-ckin' cool-er than you.


Runnin' from the scene, Hammer in my jeans
Dead bodies behind me, the cops'll never find me
Arm & Hammer Clean on my way to the honeycombe
Hustle all night tell my bitch I'm never coming home
Be there in the morning, stop cryin' bitch
The sun is home, drop it on the living room table
Bitch the money home, I know you ain't gon' stay once the money gone
So while I'm rich I pull my dick and get my fuckin' on
Youngin' on some real "Gangsta Gangsta" shit
Blame it on the neighborhood I was sanctioned in
But I'ma make sure we get them acres
Tell 'em fuck computers, we good with paper
Tell 'em fuck the world 'cause I'm hood by nature
Feelin' that way is how the hood'll make ya
The hood is vacant, the streets are empty, yeah
Mr. Bush, rebuild the city, but


Yeah, over like yesterday floatin' to the floodgates
This is New Orleans, welcome to the blood state
A blood bath, and you ain't nothin' but tub bait
No political justice not even the judge safe
If his ass can't swim he get a closed case
We need our own space, I ain't talkin' about Jupiter
No luck, no help and we the fuckin' future
I'm a hoosier, usually the cool one
But when I need it, I turn into a looter
God forgive, but do he forgive the brutal
Even when it's for the better of your junior
Soon you see that life's just another movie
And the main character dies at the end, usually
There's nothin' that haven't been done that you can do to me
I been hit, I been shot nigga shoot at me!


Yeah, Money on the mind, murder in the plans
Disturbin' if you may, but it's dinner for the fam
Hustler by law, support when I can
Hustle when I can, tell me nothing I'm a man
Smell my shit as I walk off the stand
Nuts to my feet with my heart in my hand
Pardon my G, but I'm one of a kind
Been shot two times, here to put it in a rhyme
Slow lane, move the Coupe like a 5
If I get pulled over, bitch I'm gon' do time
And I know my niggaz love me, but they can't do mine
So I gotta be smart, get bread or get behind
Get lost or get in line
But the carpet's still fine
So keep tryin', the whole world turnin' back
But we keep tryin' until we get our piece, no piece
Keep Firin'


Bah


Money ain't shit, bitches ain't neither
You know I'm on that grass, don't cut on the sprinklers
Pussy on my mind, on my breath and on my fingers
Niggas try to bite my style, but my style a jalepeno
I got skinny ass jeans, trucks on the pocket
Money talks, nigga, I'm caught up in that gossip
You know all my bitches badder, and all my swishas fatter
I milk this shit like cattle, that's my word like Scrabble
And yo main girl is a ho, I go Wayne's World in her throat
She swallow so many nuts, you fuck around, find a squirrel in her throat
I go tape worm in that ho, let my snake squirm in that ho
Nigga we take turns in that ho, these niggas so green they glow
I am the best thing since wet pussy, on my private jet with my chef cookin'
So big headed my neck crooked, my niggas foul when the ref's lookin'
My big bro is Mack Maine, so much weed I got grass stains
Deez nuts, that's baggage claim, I'm on them trees like Candy Canes
Lil Tunechi


I might book me for a show
Charge my ass the low and pick up the whole dough
That's hustlenomics, I was high in my class pictures
I like math, all I did was add bitches
Swagga galore, got your girl on all fours
It's not doggystyle, I call it froggystyle
You dog her out, I tell her, hop in
2 Chainz, my first chain had a twin
Gas in my blunt, watching espn
And, if that pussy good I wanna see her again
Yeah, I'm from College Park and I got ya broad with me
Salt water pool, I can put a shark in it
Everything authentic, plus I named my pistols
Last name fuck, first name I Don't Give A
Pockets look pregnant, they 'bout to deliver
So when I start pimpin', you know the procedure


All my niggas gangstas, all my bitches freaks
I tickle her pussy, got that pussy tickle pink
I'm the heart of the streets, and I just skipped a beat
And if that pussy sweet, I want that candy, trick or treat
I got diamonds in my teeth, so all my words are precious
I'm so fuckin' hot I sssssss... I'ma need some more S's
Man I'm on some other shit, I want another bitch
That want another bitch, and I don't cuddle bitch
I hit her with that shovel dick, I got in that pussy and dug a ditch
Some people gotta punch the clock, man I rather punch a brick
Cuz I'm that nigga, and I'm so cold I just shivered
These niggas think they hard, these niggas just nipples
I pop a nigga like a scicle, drop a nigga like a missle
Mo' money mo' issues, I size you up then fix you
Tunechi


Out of sight, out of mind,

Do we run?
Should I hide?
For the rest, of my life.

Verse 1:
Dear Anne
My number 1 fan
I write with the light from the lamp on my nightstand
With my pen in my right hand
And that's also my mic hand
Codeine in the sprite can
Ink on the white pad
And I'm thinking of life, Anne
And wrong and right, Anne
And sometimes I'm right
And sometimes I might
Ca-can I find the light?
Still my rhymes are bright
So I continue my plan
And I'm sure (shore) like white sand
That they'll be price payin'
Before my flight land
But still, I want to see more than my sight can
Adore, so I can't ignore
What I want anymore
So I just go, you can call me the Gore
And oh yeah
I got a girl, she act like I owe her
And um, sometimes it seems like I just don't know her
And yeh, the relationship is starting to feel like a chore
But I really hope I'm not starting to bore
Page 1.
Out of sight, out of mind, 
Out of time, to decided.
Do we run?
Should I hide?
For the rest, of my life.
X2
Dear Anne
My number 1 fan
I write you this letter
I hope everything's grand
I hope everyone's good
I hope everybody's praying


I hope – hold up baby, let me switch hands
See, lately I've been dealing with a lot of shit and
It's burning me and I can't get out of this pan
And every time I look there's a problem with this man
But I ain't tryna expose, I'm just tryna expand
But your support held me up like kickstands
And I'm also being more careful in how I pick friends
And I'm tryna stay up out them chick's pants
(Laughs) but, I just can't
But, on another note, this ain't just another note
This is more than a rap
This is more of an oath
And I know you're wondering what this letter is for
And I'm just hoping that you read this far
Page 2
Out of sight, out of mind, 
Out of time, to decided.
Do we run?
Should I hide?
For the rest, of my life.
X2
Dear Anne
My number 1 fan
By now you probably think I'm portraying who I'm sayin
And sometimes I wish I wasn't him, but I am
And it's people like you that make me part of what I am
But hey, you are the shit
Damn, pardon the gram (grammar)
But it's like you make me feel like I'm a part of the fam
And shit, when my life be like some sort of exam
It's a jungle out there- lions, horses and rams
Shit, as I sit and wait for the war to began
I just think of you, then I'm rewarded again
And, with you, is where my artistry can
And, so with you is where a part of me stands
And, I hope I see you in the stands
Anne, because you know I understand
And, and I'm sorry about Stan
So I wrote this to say I'm your number 1 fan.
Out of sight, out of mind, 
Out of time, to decided.
Do we run?
Should I hide?
For the rest, of my life.

Life is a traffic jam but I'm on a motor bike
Zig-zagging past these bastards, laughing at them
I got them suicidal like the doors on the Phantom
Yeah, hot spitter nigga, who you thought it was
Bitches want to hold me in the morning like a coffee mug
I don't try to lock them down cause I'm not an officer
I just knock them down in groups of ten
As if I'm in the lane aiming for bowling pins
Then the style switch so quick
Have you thinking that the disc skipped
Pimping serious
Make them bring it back like pass interferance

Baby understand me now
If sometimes you see that I'm mad
Don't you know no one alive can always be an angel
When everything goes wrong, you see some bad
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
O lord please don't let me be misunderstood


Misunderstood ain't gotta be explained
But you don't understand me so let me explain
Stood in the heat, the flames, the snow
Please slow down hurricane
The wind blow, my dreads swang
He had hair like wool, like wayne
Dropping ashes in the bible
I shake em out and they fall on the rifle
Scary, hail mary no tale fairy
All real very, extraordinary
Perry mason facing, the barrel if he tattle
My God is my judge, no gown no gavel
I'm a rebel, down to battle
Now or never, I would never?
Fucking fantastic, fuck if you agree
But I don't give a fuck if you see me


I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
O lord please don't let me be misunderstood


What's understood ain't gotta be explained
So for those who understand meet Dwayne
For 8 and a half months I gave ms. cit da pain
Now it's young money baby, keep the change
My mama say fuck em and we the same
So hello mothafucka you got some sheets to change
And ain't it funny how people change like easter sunday
You know church fit then outfit,
Bright pink and green chest look house lit
Bright pinky rings but that ain't about this
What you bout bitch
Excuse my french emotion in my passion
But I wear my heart on my sleeve like it's the new fashion
What are you asking, if I don't have the answer
It's probably on the web, like I'm a damn tarantula
But I know you don't understand, cause you thought lil wayne is weezy
But weezy is dwayne


I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
O lord please don't let me be misunderstood


I was watchin T.V. the other day right
Got this white guy on there talkin bout black guys
Talkin about how young black guys are targeted
Targeted by who?
America
You see, one in every 100 Americans are locked up
1 in every, 9 black Americans are locked up
And see what the white guy was trying to stress was that
The money that we spend on sending a motherfucka to jail
A young motherfucka to jail
Would be less to send, his or her young ass to college (heh)
See, and another thing the white guy was stressing was that
Our jails are populated with drug dealers
You know crack, cocaine, yeah, stuff like that
Meanin due to the laws we have on crack cocaine and regular cocaine
The police are only
I don't want to say only right, but shit
Only logic by riding around in the hood all day
And not in the suburbs, because
Crack cocaine is mostly found in the hood
And um, you know the other thing is mostly found...
You know where I'm going
But why bring a motherfucka to jail
If it's not gonna stand up in court
Because this drug ain't that drug
You know level 3, level 4 drug, shit like that (heh heh)
Mmm hmm, I guess it's all a misunderstanding, and um
I sit back and think well shit us young motherfuckers,
You know, that 1 in every 9
We probably only selling the crack cocaine just because we in the hood
And it's not like the suburbs
We don't have the things that you have
Why? I really don't want to know the answer, but uh...
I guess we just misunderstood uh, yeah
You know we don't have room in the jail
Now for the real motherfuckers, the real criminals, you know
Sex offenders, rapists, serial killers, shit like that
Don't get scared, don't get scared
I know you saw one them sex offenders papers
Don't trip, he live right on the end of your block, mmm hmm
Yeah, that nigga live right down the street from you
Sex offender on a level 3 drug, convicted, ex-con, yeah, check him out
And what you got, you got daughters, son, what you got?
Yeah, well you know what
You know what? I have a fuckin daughter
You understand me? And, why the fuck would you bring my neighbor
To jail just because the reason why he live next door to me
Ain't the reason why I live next door to him
Mean that, he didn't rap his way to my fuckin neighborhood
He sold crack cocaine to get to my neighborhood
You move him out, bring him to jail for life
And then you move in a sex offender, heh heh heh
They giving me a paper, heh heh
Is that a misunderstanding, cause I don't understand it
ANother thing, let me take my glasses off
Cause I want to see the reaction on the faces when I say this
Uh, Mr. Al Sharpton, here's why I don't respect you
And nobody like you, hmm hmm, see
You're the type that gets off on gettin on other people, heh hehe
That's not good, no homo
And rather unhuman I should say
I mean, given the fact that humanity, well, good humanity rather
To me, is helpin one another, no matter your color or race
But this guy, and people like him
They'd rather speculate before they informate, if that's a word, heh heh
You know, spect before check, anyway
Mean that, I much rather you talk to me first and see if you
Can learn an opinion before you make one
Just my thought of good humanity, Mr. Sharpton (heh heh)
Hold on, I ain't finished with you man
Gotta pluck the ashes, mmm hmm, hold on, um
Mr. Sharpton, and anyone like you, you don't know me
So, if you're not goin to try to, then what you say
Or think about me, or whatever I do is totally Casper the friendly ghost
To me, and, it doesn't make you a good person to
Criticize before you improvize
Doesn't necessarily make you a bad person neither but
The characteristics fall heavily into bad sway, hah hah
But since I am human, I am good and bad as well
But I try my hardest to stay good
And some of the things I do and say may be bad, or just not too good
But I do try
So with that said, I don't fault you, I mean, you're only human
Good or bad, but I also don't respect you
And I don't care if that's good or bad, heh heh
You see you are no MLK, you are no Jesse Jackson
You a nobody, to me, you're just another Don King with a perm
Heh heh, just a little more political
And that just means you're a little unhuman than us humans
And now, let me be human by sayin fuck Al Sharpton
And anyone like him, fuck if you understand me
I love being misunderstood, why?
Cause I live in the suburbs but I come from the hood
Bring the hook in!


I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood


Dough is what I got, lil mama
Dough is what I got, pretty lady
Dough is what I got, shortie
Dough is what I got, baby
C'mon, I'm paid [x4]


Give a woman none, uh-huh
I already gave my brother some, it's my sister turn
Ain't it funny how the fish do burn
But your boy just relax like a fresh new perm
At the world in the barrel of the pistol term
Well we get it how we live never live and learn
Gotta talk about the flow cause you is concerned
Only down south rapper could've been in tha firm
Or the commissioner of Wu-Tang nigga
Tryna tell you I can kick it like Liu Kang nigga
Got the Sub-Zero flow how you want me ma
Nigga get over here like Scorpion
And when it comes down to this recording
I must be Lebron James if he's Jordan
No, I want ringsfor my performance
I'm more Kobe Bryant of an artist
Same coach, same game, been starting
...Same triangle offense
I come through the lane like dargent
Refree niggaz is lame they call charging
I have no brain I'm retarded
We are not the same I'ma Martian
You can be my Jane i'm your Tarzan
I'm from the jungle where the snakes is all poison
I am magnificent like Marcus
You might wanna fall back like August
Or late september whatever you call it
I hit niggaz in the head like Vonage
I am talking to no particular audience
But understand I'm the guardian
And understand there won't be no guardin him
You will just get played like an accordion
I don't give a damn if she's bossy
I keep pussy running like a faucet
She better catch like she Steve Largent
Because I'm "What's up" like "Martin"


See I know y'all be talking about and you don't like what you here sometimes
But um um since I'm so bright I'ma put the spotlight on you baby


Show me what you bout, lil daddy
I know you need to stop, stop hatin

Where's my coffee?
Good Morning Doctor Carter (Hey Sweetie)
Looks like it's going to be a long day. (Ahh another one hmm, what we got?)
Your first patient, (Yeah)
Is suffering from a lack of concept, (Uh-Huh)
Originality, (Ugh)
His flow is weak, (Another one)
And he has no style. (Ugh)
Whatcha got for um?


Ok. Let me put my gloves on and my scrubs on. Dr. Carter to the rescue. Excuse me if I'm late,
But like a thief it takes time to be this great.
Ha! So just wait. Your style is a disgrace,
Your rhymes are 5th. Place and I'm just grace.
One, Uno, Ace and I'm tryin to make your heart beat like bass,
But it's sweet like cake and I come to fix
Whatever you shall break. Where is your originality?
You are so fake so picture me like a gallery.
Capture What I say. All I need is one mic. All I need is one take.
Like hey, brighter then the sun ray got a pistols on the playground.
Watch the gun play like. No kidding. No kids in the way,
But the kids do watch. Gotta Watch what we say. Gotta work everyday.
Gotta not be Cliche.
Gotta stand out like Andre 3K.
Gotta, kick it, kick it like the sensate.
You gotta have faith you gotta gotta wait wait...
I think I, I think I lost him.


Dial 1. 18 please.


Good afternoon Dr. Carter. (Worse?)
I don't know about this one.
His confidence is down,
Vocab. And meta fores needs work,
And he lacks respect for the game. (uggghhhhaaaa, let me see)
Do you think you can save him?


Okay.
Respect is in the heart.
So that's where I'm a start.
And a lot of heart patients don't make it.
But hey kids
Plural I graduated
Cause you could get through anything if Magic made it.
And that was called recycling
Or rereciting
Something cause you just like it
So you say it just like it.
Some say it's biting
But I say it's enlightning,
Besides Dr. Kanye West is one of the brightest.
And Dr. Swizz can stitch your track up the tightest.
And Dr. Jeezy can fix your back up the nicest.
Authritist in my hand from writing.
But I'm a docter they don't understand my writing.
So I stop writing.
Now I'm like lighting.
And you ain't Vince Young so don't clash with the Titans.
Fast and exciting.
My Passion is Frighting.
Now let me put some more Vocab in your I. V.
Here take this Vicatin
Like it and love it
And confidence has no budget, so pay me no mind I don't walk like I talk it cause I'm running I don't do it cause I done it and I'm in the emergency punnet.
Got dammit I lost another one.


Good evening Dr. Carter,
It's been a long day,
This one is much better than the others,
His respect is back up,
Concepts sound good,
Style is showin strong side of improvement,
All he needs now is his swagger.


Let me take the gloves off then.
Swagger Tighter Then A Yeast Infection.
Fly Go Hard Like Yeast Erection.
Fashion Patrol Police Detection.
I Stay Tight Like Chinese Connection.
I Stay Tight Like pussy At Night.
Baby Don't Get Me Wrong I Could Do That pussy Right.
But I'm Too Wrong To Write.
Too Fresh To Fight.
Too Paid To Freestyle.
Too Paid To Freestyle.
I Had To Say It Twice
Swagger So Nice.
And Don't Ask Me shit Unless It Concern A Price.
And I Don't Rap Fast I Rap Slow.
Cause I Mean Every Letter In The Words In The Sentence Of My Quotes.
Swagger Just Flow Sweeter Then Honey Oats.
That Swagger I Got It I Wear It Like A Coat.
Wait, As I Put The Light Down His Throat.
I Can Only See Flow.
His Blood Starting To Flow.
His Lungs Starting To Grow.
This One Starting To Show.
Strong Signs Of Life.
Wheres The Stitches Heres The Knife.
Smack His Face His Eyes Open.
I Reply With A Nice Welcome Back.
Hip Hop I Saved Your Life.


He looks good,
His vitals are up,
He's looking good,
He's looking good,
I think we got one,
Dr. Carter I think we got one,
Yep, yep we got one,
You saved him he's good,
He's good,
He's good,
We got one he's good,
He's good,
You got him,
We saved him,
He's a goner.
He's good.

My Woman turn my dick into a mazda lord
Body ports in the duffel, the bullets turn your body to a puzzle
The money turn my bitch into a monster she know how to get a check and turn a 0 to a comma lord
The money turn my niggas into killas
The sugar turned the cocaine to Vanilla
The money turned the bitches into hoes
The money turned my niggas into foes lord... 
I put my shooters on they feet
Give em' yo address and I go out to eat
Had that Snowman in the hood like Jody Breeze
She from the hood but look like she from overseas
I say "Girl you know I Love You and I care for ya
I got some new shoes and a bag of hair for ya"
She say "Fuck these other niggas they ain't half of ya
Just keep laughing to the bank, it's hilarious"
I got a stay at home Gun and a Travel gun
Boy we can sell white in Africa
It's like I can't explain, yall asked me to spit
Now I'm drooling on my chain what happened to Wayne?
I'm like hold up wait a second, yall thought I was second?
Hating on a champ throwing salt and not confetti
We pull up and we shoot then we park the car and at it
Watch me pull up with no roof that's cause I walk the dog and pet it, I'm like hold up wait a minute yall thought I was finished?
Shoot you in your head then just walk off like I didn't
Let my money talk so much put my jawbone outta business
Doing numbers in this bitch I'm like a smart bone with the digits, Bitch! 
Riding round with the volume down, with the windows up and the choppers down
Soon as we get to yo block it's the fucking other way around
My bitch say I'm too wild she don't even know why she stay around
I get home and I dick her down now she talking bout' exchange the vows
If these bullets was paint balls I could fuck around and I could paint a house
You could tell I pimpin' the way I hit the blunt with my pinky out
I bring Wine to Amy House we smoke it out and we drank it out, and talk about these pussy niggas that ain't about what Wayne about
I'm hanging out a mussane without a brain is outta his mind
I pull over I push a button it change like Optimus Prime
Speaking of change it's a shame how these lames dropping them dimes
We aim at your grape knock it off now you just Vines
Blood Gang red rain on these niggas hot if you dry
My gang top of the line yelling out "Squad Take it outside!"
Imma tax player, imma Axe player, getting in through the back wayer, Red double to the Blue collar unenvelope black mail
Fed up with the Fed shit and Fed-ex lost my package
My white girls say "Yeah nigga" my white homies act blackish
Ain't tall enough for the NBA, I ain't big enough for the NFL
Shouldve been in N.W.A. fuck the police, 5-0 and 12
One time If you don't mind bitch, never say nevermind bitch
You a penny short of a dime bitch no nonsense outta nonsense [?] that was non bitch, Yeah! 
Born to murder bank account on fat bustin' out the girdle
Tellem boys and nothing sweet it's sauerkraut Ya heard me?
They find ya body in New Orleans from Mardi Gras on Bourbon
Like oh lord! Humphrey Bogart
It's a bird it's a plane, it's a crowbar
For the most part, I'm the southern coast guard... 
Ak-47 spitting flame like a blow torch
Sorry 4 The Wait

(Lil Wayne)
I got ice in my veins, blood in my eyes
Hate in my heart, love in my mind
I seen nights full of pain, days of the same
You keep the sunshine, save me the rain
I search but never find, hurt but never cry
I work and forever try, but I'm cursed, so never mind
And it's worse, but better times seem further and beyond
The top gets higher the more that I climb
The spot gets smaller, and I get bigger
Tryna get into where I fit in, no room for a nigga
But soon for a nigga it be on, mu'fucka
'Cause all the bullshit, it made me strong, mu'fucka
So I pick the world up and I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
Bitch, I'ma pick the world up and I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
And I could die now, Rebirth motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, motherfucker
I'm gone
Motherfucker, I'm gone
I know what they don't wanna tell you
Just hope you're heaven-sent, and you're hell-proof
I-I walk up in the world and cut the lights off
And confidence is the stain they can't wipe off
Huh, my word is my pride
But wisdom is bleak, and that's a word from the wise
Served to survive, murdered and bribed
And when it got too heavy I put my burdens aside
So I could pick the world up and I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
Bitch, I'ma pick the world up and I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
And I could die now, Rebirth motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, motherfucker
I'm gone
Motherfucker, I'm gone (I'm gone)


(Eminem)
It hurts, but I never show this pain you'll never know
If only you could see just how lonely and how cold
And frostbit I've become, my back's against the wall
When push come to shove, I just stand up and scream "Fuck 'em all"
Man, it feels like these walls are closing in
This roof is caving in, up it's time to raise it then
Your days are numbered like pages in
My book of rhymes, got 'em cookin', boy
This crooked mind of mine got 'em all
Shook and scared to look in my eyes
I stole that fuckin' clock
I took the time and I
Came up from behind
And pretty much snuck up
And butt-fucked this game up
Better be careful when you bring my name up
Fuck this fame, that ain't what
I came to claim but the game
Ain't gonna be the same on the day that I leave it
But I swear one way or another I'ma make these fuckin' haters believe that
I swear to God, won't spare the rod
I'm a man of my word, so your fuckin' heads better nod
Or I'ma fuck around in this bitch and roast everybody
Sleep on me, that pillow is where your head'll lie
Permanently, bitch, it's beddy-bye
This world is my Easter egg, yeah, prepare to die
My head is swole, my confidence is up
This stage is my pedestal
I'm unstoppable, incredible-
Hulk, you're trapped in my medicine ball
I could run circles around you so fast your fuckin' head'll spin, dog
I split your cabbage and your lettuce and olives
I'll fuckin'
Pick the world up and I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
Bitch, I'ma pick the world up and I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
And I could die now, Rebirth motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, motherfucker

Ooh girl, you gon' get this dick, we don't do romance

I woke up in that pussy and starting stroking
You woke up and said "Go baby"
She said fuck me rough, don't take it easy on me
Don't do me no favors

You spark it up, we charcoal
Got a bad bitch with long hair that have bad days when the mall closed
I'm a big dog, big doghouse, make ashtrays out of dog bowls
Blessins on top of sins, restin' with topless twins
Picture me broke but forgot to take the top off the lens
In the restaurant, I’m with Slim
Wrestlin' with lobster limbs
Talkin' about some M's, it's soundin' like gospel hymns
Yes lord

Shit I only have two goals and that is "Get Money, Get Money"
Now I'm ridin' 'round the city, with the top off the Maybach
Lookin for a motherfuckin' spot we can skate at
Elvis left the building
And I take these hoes to Graceland
And I got more bounce, to the 28 grams
I ain't stuntin these niggas, eyes look chinese
Wayne-chong to these niggas, Wayne-chong bitch! 
More than one bitch

With your hair in a pony

But I can't be there all morning
I'm a pimp baby, yeah, I'm going, going, going, gone

Damn nigga, y'all excuse the expressions


What it be like up there baby boy, ay this here ya son hollerin at ya
I miss the shit out ya, it's hard to be without ya
But I know you watchin, peepin down on how I'm livin
Ay, tell Jesus I said thanks for the blessings he sendin
Please ask him to forgive me for the sins I commit
Just let him know I'm still young and at risk
Say, I'll never forget the time that you caught me smokin herb in the house
I was dead wrong, I deserved to get out
But you just talked it over with my mom and got it situated in due time
Told me get the paper instead of high
So now I take that advice and she'd light over my whole life dog
I wanted to be just like you my whole life dog
I can't believe them niggas stole ya, that shit's pain to me
But don't trip, I hold you down, you still remain through me
And dog I know I can't see you but I bet that you smilin
And I'm a make you even happier, I promise

But I know you watchin over me nigga, I know
But the shit's steady hurtin, burn deep
But it's alright dog, everything gon' be alright dog


I know you see my daughter growin up and bad as ever
But she cool 'cause she do whatever daddy tell her
And your wife, she's still the most wonderful woman
I just built her a new house, she ain't runnin from nothin
B and Slim, them niggas still love me like they own child
Ms. Rose nerves get bad, but still she gon' smile
And me I'm on some "squash it" and some debate it
But I know they love it way more than they hate it
And I know you probably laughin at the way I treat these hoes and these
Bitches
I try love 'em, my bm be trippin
But Rabbit, you know one thing, I got the game from you, every perspective
That's why I keep the gun at close connection for protection
And you see I left school behind and chose cmb
It was impossible on the road every week, but I know enough
And I follow by everything you ever told me, think wisely
Watch over me my nigga, just guide me




I swear to you man, at some times I really wish I was with you
'Cause I get fed up with this life and I miss you
Somebody pass me a tissue, and let me wipe the tears from my eyes
Yeah, nigga I cried, it's 'cause I loved you dog
I promise I won't ever put nothin above you dog
So I live my life in dedication of you dog
I know you see me happy on the outside and hurt within
Make me wanna grab that gun and burst again
But I know they got a reason why I'm here
And I know they got a reason why you gone
And therefore, I'm succeedin on my own
But you ain't never left me, nigga, you still dwell in my heart
I can't forget you kept it real from the start
And until my last breath I exhale, I'm a keep you with me
And when we do meet again, I'm a keep you with me
And tell them niggas Pac, B. I. G. And Pun I said "thay's my peoples"
Watch over me nigga 'til I see you

Murder ain't nuttin' but a misdemeanor

No preventin' the grind, I gotta get it,
I'm admitted to the game, true playa, no quittin',
There you go shittin' on the way a nigga thinkin',
Only history I know is Benjamin Franklin,
And since the future ain't promised to no one,
I live every day like this is the sure one,
Trade in the tidal wave, this is the ocean,
Stand in that heat 'til the muthafuckin' snow come,
And it feels so fuckin' good, throw my dope like a rope let 'em tug and pull,
No hope for the hopeless, rats and roaches,
Runnin' 'cross the porch, in the attic there's a fortune,
Come and get it automatics in motion, we bangin' for the bread nigga even the molded,
I got my loaf, I got my toast, chaperone of the South I got my coast,
Yeah, and until I die, I'm da da-da da-da da best rapper alive!

Look at the bullshit we been through
Had the niggas sittin on top they roofs
Hurricane Katrina, we shoulda called it Hurricane (Geeoorrggiaa) Bush
Then they tellin y'all lies on the news
The white people smiling like everythin cool
But I know people that died in that pool
I know people that died in them schools
Now what is the survivor to do?
Got to no trailer, you gotta move
Now it's on to Texas and to (Geeoorrggiiaa)
They tell you what they want, show you what they want you to see
But they don't let you know what's really goin on
Make it look like a lotta stealin goin on
Boy them cops is killas in my home
Nigga shot dead in the middle of the street
I ain't no thief, I'm just tryin to eat
Man fuck the police and president (Geeoorrrggiiaa) Bush
So what happened to the leverage, why wasn't they steady
Why wasn't they able to control this?

Everybody drowned, and
Everybody died, but baby I'm still prayin wich ya
Everybody cryin but (Georgia)
Aint nobody tried, there's no doubt on my mind it was (Georgia) Bush

New Orleans baby, now the white house hatin, tryin to wash away like we not on the map
Wait, have you heard the latest, they sayin you gotta have paper if you tryin to come back
Niggas thinkin it's a wrap, see we can't hustle in nature, we ain't from (Geeoorrggiaa)
Noooww it's them dead bodies, them lost houses, the mayor say don't worry bout it
And the children have been scarred, no ones here to care bout em
And fash out, to all the rappers that helped out
Yea we like it they callin y'all, but fuck president (Geeoorrggiaa) Bush
We see them Confederate flags, you know what it is
A white cracker muthafucka that probably voted for him
And no he ain't gonna drop no dollas, but he do drop bombs

Spend a condo and a club, one bottle won't do
Two bottles won't do, bottles for the whole crew, thanks
And bring me that Patrone, I don't play
No ice I like my drink straight, not gay
And bitch that bank come everyday, I'm paid
I wish a nigga come invade, get sprayed
I stomp a nigga out like I got ten legs
Then they fish the nigga up out the lake in ten days
Behave, no ho, I'm on that Rage Rov
Cash Money, Young Money, ho that money age old
And can't a cage hold this animal from Hollygrove
Sorry mami I be stoned, I be, I be, I be blowed

Gotta pay me now for me to even take these hos
Price sizin for a show and the flow

Gangin in the cheese, Them bricks is comin'

An the law don't bother me, I give the pigs a couple of G's

Twenty wrists tweeds completed

Whatever you want, Holla at me when you need to get it

Standin on stage in front of thousands

That's real talk, I know a lot of y'all got 'em
But you need 'em way more when you gotta go without 'em
And I'm without 'em, but that's life y'all
Sometimes you gotta learn to swim with no lifeguard
I'm alright God, shit I'm still breathin
But lose hurt like bullets, I'm about to start bleedin
Throw me down some comfort, cause my heart need it
Tryin to cope wit my chances and meet 'em
There's a dark road ahead, but I'm tryin to take it easy

Smoke cush all day and pop painkillers
Fuck who don't understand it, this what the game did us
This what the streets showed us
This how the block made us, the same block where they layed 'em
I pray every time I cross the spot on the pavement, save me
Lord will I be next for the taking? Take me
I know I'm livin like I know when I'm comin
But I'm just livin cause I know that it's comin
And the end is comin, but I ain't runnin
I and hidin and duckin, I'm in the middle of a war, I'm alive and love it
I'm just speakin from the heart of the diein public
We still beatin, we gon rise above it
Though it seem like they cheatin and we loosin
We survive if nothin, they could never take the stride from strugglin

And sometimes that ride get bloody
But I just think about my buddy and go after that money, but uhh..

And all the things I never said, I gotta say it now

Now I gotta walk around, brim down
Just tryin to find my way to the next day, escape
Ya birthday could be ya death date
So I'm livin like it was just yesterday, let's pray
Ten fingers together, can't bring 'em together
It's murda murda, I don't think it get better
So be a competitor or get out the weather

That's real nigga talk, these niggas speechless
Cut off his arm and leg like I charge for my features
Hammer on my side like I work in construction
Your bitch hit that head so hard we get concussions
Niggas can't see me, not even a glimpse
Too many banana clips, I feel like chimps
South beach bitch and I tan line stupid
You could find me on collins like bootsy

Your girl do tongue tricks and you sweeter than one six
All I ever see is ben franklin face

Bird call, brr, what happened to that boy?
He was talkin' shit, we put a clap into that boy
Tunechi!


Uhh, she got that good good,
She Michael Jackson Bad,
I'm attracted to her,
With her attractive ass,
You get her the matching bags,
I get her to pack them bags,
Get straight in that taxi cab,
Come straight to my bachelor pad,
I hate to see her go,
But I love to watch her leave,
I keep her comin' back,
Like she forgot her keys,
And now we're murderers,
Because we kill time,
She saw doctor carter and now she feel fine,


I like the way you walking if you walking my way,
I'm that red bull now lets fly away,
Lets buy a place,
With all kinds of space,
I'll let you be the judge,
And and I'm the case,
I'm gudda gudda,
I putta other,
I see me with her
No stevie wonder,
She don't even wonder,
Cos she know she bad,
And I got her n-gga, grocery bags,


Look, look at you (at you)
Bad, yes you are,
She roll with us,
Look at how she walks,
I like the way you talk,
Damn you know it, damn you know it,
And she know it and she know it,
Your so, You know,
Your so, you know,


Ok I get it, let me think,
I guess it's my turn,
Maybe it's time to put this p-ssy on your sideburns,
You say I'm bad, you probably right,
He pressing me like button downs on a friday night,
I'm so pretty like, be on my pedal bike,
Be on my low scrunch,
Be on my egg and whites,
You say Nicki don't stop you the bestest,
And I just be coming off the top asbestos,


I love your sushi roll,
Hotter than Wasabi,
I race for your love,
Shake and bake ricky bobby,
I'm at the W but I can't meet you at the lobby,
Girl I gotta watch my back cos I'm not just anybody,
I see em stand in line just to get beside her,
I let her see the Aston, and let the rest surprise her,
Cos when we disappear, you need gps to find her,
Oh that was you girl,
I thought I recognised her,




She like tanning,
I like staying in,
She like romancing,
I like rollin with friends,
She said I'm caged in,
I think her conscious is,
She watching them dat oxygen,
I'm watching espn,
But when the shows ends she all in my skin,
Lotions, no emotions, rollarcoasting like back forth,
Hold it (hold it, hold it, hold it)
She pose like it's for posters,
And I poke like I'm supposed to,
Take this photo if you for me,
Don't you ever show this,
I'm too loyal, and too focused
To be losing and be hopeless,
When I spoke this she rejoiced it,
Tell your words, get me open,
So I closed it, where your clothes is?

To be honest, I don't think we gonna go to my truck cause her cousin's with her and she looking better than her
Yeah, she's fat in the ass, slim in the waist, kinda pretty and she down to take the shit in the face
Licking all on her lips, cause she love how I taste
It's dripping on her chin, hope it don't fall on my?

Give it to ya from the back and make you cough up a lung
Or give a little brain and cough up a sun
I bust two times and then I toss up a one
Now shake it baby, it took your momma 9 months to make you baby
Enter the bedroom, we won't make a baby
Get your kneee pads on, no skating baby

Now go down girl, give head, go down Go down girl, give head, go down Now go down, girl, give head,


Woo, this that shit they didn’t want me on
I’m ‘bout to act a badonkadonk, shamone, shamone
Don't need sugar, I need cream, I'm dark and strong
The garbage man puttin' on cologne around my room
I'm on, I'm on, this that shit they didn't want
I act a ass and shit a skunk, I will, I won't
Black your eye like will.i.am, you Willy Wonka
That's me in the Lam, I'm disappearin' like Jimmy Hoffa
AK-47 my business partner, business is swell
French kiss a bitch, she don't speak French, can't kiss and tell
I push his ass in the wishin' well, then wish him well
Sippin' syrup like ginger ale, but I'm the quickest snail
From here to Hell, I hear them hail, I give them hell
I'm spittin' hail, I'm Clinton, well, I did inhale
These niggas frail, they Chip and Dale, they little girls
Watch me act a donkey, then pin a tail, spit out your nails
Uh, glory, hallelujah
Holy shit, I'm the holy shit, I'm God's manure
I know how to hack a jeweller ward and not computers
I meditate like a Buddhist, Holy ramen noodles
And now you sleep, I'm inside your room wit' a lot of shooters
You wake up to this chopper tool, it's like, 'Cock-a-doodle'
I'm awkward, cuckoo, I turn your Froot Loop to chocolate Yoo-Hoo
I'm hotter than Honolulu, glory unto you, glory


I'm awkward, cuckoo, I turn your Froot Loop to chocolate Yoo-Hoo
I'm hotter than Honolulu, my clothes and socks and shoes new
I been a boo-boo since ga-ga goo-goo and Dada, FUBU
Make everybody that knew you boo-boo, I got them spooked too
I drive a neutral, shock the future like Dr. Luther
I'm not accuser, your mom a cougar, I sock it to her
My cocaine white as a white beluga, I like bazookas
I'm high as lunar, I'm wilder than Tyga's Nikes, Pumas
Woo, this that shit you didn't want me on
My weed louder than underarms and car alarms
Cheers, I said, 'Surprise', but couldn't party long
I got to get back to the grind and the drawin' board
But all this fuckin' art destroyed, this the art of war
These niggas' soft as teddy bears, talk to Marky Mark
I wet your block, leave it a waterpark, broad or dark
I whip the work like tartar sauce, you want it hard or raw, huh?


Uh, glory, hallelujah
Holy shit, I'm the shit, Porta-Potty Tunechi
Unload the Glock profusely, I'm soarin' out confusion
Your motor mouth keep vroomin', I'm goin' Tony Stewart
I'm on the fluid, I'm ruined, I'm cold as Boston Bruins
Lost in the shoo-shoo and who's who and I lost influence
Lost my point of view 'til I find a mirror, start talkin' to it
It told me the truth, it said I'm the shit and you party poopin'
Lord, oh, Lord


Am I talkin' crazy, too much coffee maybe
I smell like money, I know broke niggas feel nauseated
The broads' elated, my boys are faded, my car's the latest
My bars the greatest, they rated X like Marvel made it
She caught the babies, she barfed the babies, they orphans maybe
We got that white girl like in the '80s, that Marcia Brady
I dicked Tracy like Warren Beatty, I'm warm as Haiti
I'm armed and lazy, I'm sprayin' until my arms is lazy
Pardon my mental, I'm higher than Continental
Went from flyin' cockroaches to flyin' without credentials
That's private, tell the pilot, 'Be quiet, we need our privacy'
Throw you off this bitch if you wired, justifiably
Hustle wit' a motive, you know this, I'm wit' my whoadies
No snakes, no rodents, no ad-libs, no chorus
No stress, no worries, took you to a respiratory
It's self-explanatory, the glory is mandatory, glory


Uh, glory, hallelujah
Holy shit, I can't hold this shit, my bowel's looser
My towel's newer, my powder room is for powder-users
You see rolled up dollar bills filled wit' snot and mucus
My tie is Lucas, my driver's crusin', my partner's ruthless
My flower's rootless, my pocket's roofless, she poppin' roofies
I'm not a student, I'm not assumin' I'm not a human
You are not immune to this kind of music, you got 'em, Tunechi
You got 'em, Tunechi, I got 'em

Leavin behind just residue and bones
In your residents with Rugers to your dome

Now I'm getting head on the balcony on Bourbon
Apple and Eagle is the street that I shop
The Birdman my daddy and we fly south
And we don't go to work man we get work out
And the bricks may go as low as ten up in the drought
Niggaz is selling and you should be buying

Uh, my mind’s filled with mine fields
The ashes fall, the wine spills
The world stops, drops and rolls
It’s Judgment Day or a fire drill
Yea, I pour out my heart, have a drink
They say the drunk never lie, they ain’t never lyin yea
My country tis of thee,
Sweet land of kill em all and let em die


God bless Amerika
This ole' godless Amerika
I heard tomorrow ain’t promised today
The end of time is like a hour away


Damn, military minded, lost and can’t find it
The stars on the flag are never shining
Uh, I saw a butterfly in hell today
Will I die or go to jail today?
Cause I live by the sword and die by the sword
Heard police was looking for me, I’mma hide by abroad
Shootin stars in my pocket, bitch sit on my rocket
I’m wired off a socket, but still shocking
Everybody wanna tell me what I need
You can play a role in my life but not the lead
If there’s food for thought then I’m guilty of greed
Mama said take what you want – I took heed yea
Now let it breathe, yea, back to life, back to reality
Been eating my girl and she’s so sweet, got cavities
Granted we do it for vanity not humanity
But what’s appealing to me is under banana trees, love
I go so hard, I tried to pay homage but I was overcharged
Ain’t that a bitch? I’m just a nut tryna bust a nut in the nut shell
Used to say fuck the police, now I say fuck jail
Same shit, different air freshner
I don’t play boy, I ain’t Hugh Hefner
Tryna be a step ahead, but a few feet behind
Two fingers to my head, pop! Peace of mind
I be in the cloud, cloud number 9
And I just fucked the clock and let it come to time
It’s a cold world, I put on a mink
There’s a chain of commands, I’m the missing link


God bless Amerika
This ole' godless Amerika
I heard tomorrow ain’t promised today
And I’m smoking on them flowers, catch the bouquet


Here we live by the sword and die by the sword
The police are looking for me, I’mma hide by abroad
Shootin stars in my pocket, bitch sit on my rocket
I’m wired off a socket, but still shockin em
Everybody wanna tell me what I need
You can play a role in my life but not the lead
I saw a butterfly in hell today
Will I die or go to jail today?

Okay, I'm talkin' about a
Good girl, gone bad
Crooked world, wrong path
Right Mom, wrong Dad
I sing this song mad, but not mad enough to shoot you
But it just eats me up, like some bbq from Luther's
In the mornin' with the roosters
On the corner with the boosters
And she's the freshcut and they're on her like sutures
And I wanna talk to her
But her Mama has to school her
I wanna see her better
She's the weather of my future
I don't wanna see another hurricane
Baby you can kill the pain
If you just let me explain
Trust me I know what I'm sayin'
You will end up on the track of an oncoming train
Stuck in the passenger seat
Travlin' through the fast lane


Well once upon a time, there was a Mom and a Dad
Who on the outside had everything people wished they had
A beautiful daughter, two story house, two car garage
And a white picket fence wrapped around the front yard
See Daddy was a doctor
And Mommy was a banker
Mommy's job got outsourced
So now Mommy's dranker
Daddy had a malpractice suit
Now he's a snorter
And all this shit's takin' place
Right in front of their daughter
She says, "Daddy what's wrong?"
But he's just too high
"Mommy what we gon' do?"
She just get drunk and cry
Caught in the middle of two wrongs, tryin' to do right
Lookin' for answers alone in the darkness of night
Shit anit right...                                                                           Lil girl gone some where out there stranded can't nobody find her and they don't understand it she was raise hood can't blame her parents lost in the sauce not the why that they planed it


And I don't walk around lookin for it, you know?, But
Yesterday It Seemed to just wander on till it found me,
The gossip found me
Then why don't you just prove it.
How? You don't know how to prove it?,
Well, what you just do is...


Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop... (Oo)
Stop, hatin' on a nigga
That is a weak emotion
The lady of a nigga
And you could get tipped
Like ya waitin on a nigga, and
Put a body bag and an apron on tha nigga


I give my all behind the mic,
But you could never see, if you sit behind the light
You don't have to pick me... To win the title fight
But I'm gone wear that championship belt soo tight
And if I'm wrong, there is no right
And if I'm wrong, there is no light
I'm tryna be polite, but you niggas in my hair like the nigga on lice
My flow is rare, these other rappers nice,
These other rappers bark,
Some of em' even bite
But I'm much more bright
I give the game sight
So before you dim the light you just might... Might... Wanna


Think it over (think it over) Oo
Think it over (think it over) Baby


Stop... Analyzin' critacizin',
You should realize what I am and start epidamizin'
Confident, got the heart of the biggest lion
Confident like fuck em all get on my dick and ride it
My flow sick, so sick, it's like my shit is dyin'
It rains a lot in my city, cause my citys cryin'
Cause my citys dyin'
But I emerge from all of that, I am a livin pio-neer, sighin'
Fear God, not them
Steer my Robin Coupe through the streets of the boot... And
Soo-woop
And, then I leave a tub in the boot, I leave a blood bath,
Sorry there's a tub in the boot, now where the drugs at?
Like the string of the shoe
No niggas want that dapslyrics
I'm twisted like the string on a boot, where New Orleans at?
I build hip hop solely like a bus pass
So in your possession, I must ask...


Hey, haven't I been good to you? (Think it over)
Tell me, haven't I been sweet to you?


Drag my name through the mud
I come out clean
Cast away stones
I won't even blink
A gun is not a math problem,
I won't even think
Just leave you dead like the meat under my sink
Don't believe in me
Don't believe me
I graduated from hungry,
And made it to greedy
My flow is like pasta
Take it and eat it
But I'm gone need g's if I'm bakin' the zeedy
You niggas want beef?
I want a steak and uh, we be
Lost in Amsterdam or Jamaica where we be
Hard body nigga, takin it easy

We never sing not even on a song where the chorus is
Dig the hole, get the wood box bring the florist in
Tell the pastor tell the family we was just warning them
38's 45's, all type of tourists'
About to hit the bong pour the holy water in
Celebrating for participating and the slaughtering
Eating steaks at the same spot they killed Pauly in
Frank White's three in the quarter taping your daughter in
Columbia with the connect putting the order in
Nigga act we gonna clap like we the audience
Make sure you ain't down to strap, get rid of all the prints
Do your homework on whoever you go to war against


I had 20s on my Benz, lend it to all my friends
And everything was all gravy, everything was all gravy
And if I need something call baby, if I need something call baby
And the streets was calling me, but a nigga had call waiting
And yeah we all went through our phases
We all went through our savings
Some niggas stayed on point, some niggas was point shaving
And sometimes we had to be vegetables
That mean we had to stay patient cause they say you are what you eat
I took the Star out of Starvation, bitch
I come from a 3rd world start rapping in the 4th grade
Start trapping in the 6th grade, went platinum in the 10th grade, dropped out a nigga was getting paid
This from Birdman had a Fade,
This when Hummers didn't come Stretch but Birdman had em' made,
This when pretty bitches set you up, and niggas didn't give two fucks
You had two guns and two phones you could waste time and get and get a new cup
But this when niggas had pimp cups, and new rappers got hemped up
And all them niggas that's biting got they Finns cut...
I know real niggas gon' fuck with this
Like "that's that shit I be talkin' 'bout"


And we gon be around til yo motherfuckin' body rock
And if the Feds bring us in we get the same time Gotti Got
And if the Feds bring us in we get the same time Gotti Got
And if the Feds bring us in we get the same time Gotti Got


But this when niggas had pimp cups, and dirty money got rinsed up
And the early birds in the worm hole would get so fat that they'd get stuck
We'd clean our fingerprints up, we'd clean the shit we didn't touch, This when niggas called Diddy Puff
Letting Biggie bump while I'm sitting up in that Big Body
I can show you a dead body
Lotta niggas got pinched, and the snitches ended up dead Lobsters
Wrap the birds in red tape call them bitches Red Robins
Pops had Kilos I needed one key I would've made Cops
Free My niggas Down and Rest In peace to all my dead Partners,
I smoke by the pound in like a week, and fuck the weight watchers
Got my self a brand new triple-beam, just the weight options
I stumbled upon a Gold Mine I thank God that it ain't Copper
Some niggas were late bloomers but boy look how they've blossomed
Don't know niggas that wear wires but I know niggas that go Haywire
I know hoes that play possum, and will bring us to y'all mailboxes
And the deadman can't talk and the Feds don't have seances
Look you put a knot on the end of a condom full of drugs and put it in her pussy
And get through Customs cause last time we just took em
I rather be blind before I be the nigga that stand around just lookin'
And you can beat around the bush and find a nigga laying behind them bushes
And I know real niggas gon' fuck with this
Like "that's that shit I be talkin' 'bout"


And we gon be around til yo motherfuckin' body rock
And if the Feds bring us in we get the same time Gotti Got
And if the Feds bring us in we get the same time Gotti Got
And if the Feds bring us in we get the same time Gotti Got

Worst fear is getting robbed for my last 50 dollars that I had left over

Minimum wage 5.15. 132s on the whip
Kept my shit clean
Actually that was my momma shit
But I'm driving round town on my Obama shit
Middle class my ass, just to get a tank of gas
Had to run the guns up the street and pawn the shit
But, yeah I'm headed for a scholarship
Little scrap game but I got a lot of lip
That's why them niggas don't like me and always wanna fight me
A dumb nigga hate a smart mouth most likely
I know the game I'm an expert
Nigga, how you gonna jump me if my legs work?
Nigga I'm gone, showed up at the crib tryna bone
And I aint fuck yet cause her momma always home

Gold medals if we gave hoes?
No rose petals on a bed in the ghettos
Spiderman sheets got us singing falsetto
Tall white tee's, can't believe we used to wear those
White folks looking at us like we're weirdos
But we was only kiddo's
Grabbing titties in the club, pocket full of skittles
Tryna get the kitty was like tryna solve a riddle
Tryna get the Diddy, cause I murder instrumentals

I got a new vision for all my shit, I don't know what to call that shit
I know, I'm selling all of my cars, I'm selling all of my watches, I'm selling diamonds and all of that shit
Realized I don't need that shit, I'm a different breed with this shit
I'm tryna turn M's to B's in this shit and I ain't ever pay to be with no bitch
I, I, I want that Brigitte Bardot hanging over my bed, fifty mill in one room
You could ask anyone out here, who running the game, and they'll tell you the truth
Man, oh look, they fuck with me now, I think they're hearin' me now
Someone said “nigga they takin' you seriously now"
I'm like "I think they might just be scared of me now"
But it's all good, niggas wrong every day, niggas wrong every day
Goin' to la where I'm tryna get high and do a song every day
Safe, we ain't ever have to play it safe
I would rather stack it up and put it in a safe
Then peek inside the safe and see I'm runnin' out of space
Mothafucka that's grindin'

Kidnap a nigga beat the truth out
Moms pick the suit out

Rock n roll Jesus with all my nails on
All I need is a bl**t and a bail bond
And give these blind mothafuck*s something to feel on
Rollin like a mothafuck*s put your wheels on
And let's roll down and heal till the heal gone
I started on the block but that something to build on
And how can I pray when I got nothing to kneel on
 
Hey
The ground is gone
Don't look now but the ground is gone
I'm so high that the ground is gone
And I don't even know which crowd I'm on
Don't look down but the ground is gone
Don't look down cause the ground is gone
Right now I'm a million miles from home
And I'm so high that the ground is gone
 
Son look up
Father just shook us
Never was around like bush is
War just came like Kane with bishop
Movies too different to act not used ta
Boys in the hood messed up
No blueprints they just do it, 
Then they get commercial shootin
Ruthless, live your T.I. or lose it
Stupid people like ya'll once knew 'em
Who da, new nigga is show and prove it, 
Never skateboard but I grinds in these Supras, 
Ya'll niggas foolin, for fame and the fortune, 
Super human, 430 flame horses
Ready to use it, L.A. to Jerusalem
Betty Bootin, my girls fake Hollywood tits
Couldn't fool 'em, I just pull up
And I hold her, yeah, and adjust, to the mood

I know a girl named Crystal her last name Paul
I look into her eyes and I can see it all
I see it when she cry, I'm there when she call
Cause I live inside of the mirror on the wall
Kill 'em all, die in the spirit of the war
Thinkin would a mind be in spiritual fall
My lyric will leave you in physical awe, 
Miserable, pitiful, ridicule, typical
Chemicals swimming through the inner tube
Get in you, that be the end of you
Times are beginnin new
Fuck what you done this about what I'm finna do
Motherfuck a 9 to 5

Motha fucker pin a guy now I write a pinnacle

Kiss my ass, and suck my genitals, tabernacle, biatch!

Verse 2 (Lil B)
Yeah I do my thing bitch what's up?
Young based god came in with the ballers
Iced out chain bitch, I'm rich with that same shit
See 5 hoes on my dick bitch it's christmas
Striaght west stide bay area bitch I'll graze em
Gritty boy bitch based god from the angles
On like a craddle and you niggas can't stop me
Shout out to Mack Mane gettin rich and cockey
Bitches still west side shout out to weezy
Young based god with that 55 heater
187 bitch I put it to 11 bitch
With that tiny shirt mane
And the tiny pants mane
I'm on based world and I fucks with cash money
My niggas don't understand man
The game like a chain
Woo woo! Swag bitch brang-dang-dang man
Bra off the top ima wolf pack hitter
My life just painting and I paint
You a pictrue mane thing bout it young
Paid ass nigga This tha stunt music
Bitch I just dos it and it's Lil B
And I'll muthafuckin prove it, we runnin


Dawg you gotta feel me on this one
What it be like dawg, I'm on some some adult grown up type shit
Look who I be around nigga, look who I been around nigga
Geezy, Juve and turk, B and Slim dawg pay attention dawg


Age is nothin but some digits nigga trust me on this
Cas I think I speak for every one when I say life is a bitch
I ride D L into the C L Gun right in my grip
I slip a clip in every rip, cas hatas likely ta trip
Come home to my future wife and every nite she'll flip
She end up catchin rights to her lips behind diapers and shit
But I like when we split drink Henny without ice when I'm pissed
Go to the club and start a fight thinkin I'm Tyson and shit
But I'm a man so I'm here to handle my situtions correctly
And I know I might be dumb but niggas gone definantly respect me
But in the mean partner I'm fightin gun charges in court
And in a couple of weeks our next tour about to start
Its like I'm livin happy now
Except for the fact my daughter sayin I love you daddy now
And that kinda juice me up
And I smoke about 3 blunts and puff a Kool ta bust me up
And say a prayer for everyday
Jus so I get through the stuff but I be like


(Chorus: repeat 2X)
Ahhhh man, it's complicated doin everythang on your own man
Being responsible for everybody and ya home man
And when you feel like everythang is goin wrong man
I'm gone stand cas I am a grown man


I try to keep my head up, but I die to keep my bread up
And usually I'm feed up thinkin everythangs a set up
But I get up this stick out my chest and clutch on my nuts
And I get hit up with all kinda stress and put up wit the stuff
Just trust me it's tough but I mantain to climb through it all and I still manage to be
Lil wayne therefore I shine and I ball
And dawg I live for today and hope and pray that there's a tomorrow
And I borrow confidence from out my heart when thangs get awful
And I'm walkin on the edge stuck without a salute and someway
I still pick it out and shuffle out tha confusion
And I don't need nobody so keep yo advice and jus down it
Cas ya'll cats don't really no me ya'll jus no bout me
So if my dawgs be on my side they keep me combile with spirit
And plus I no my fathers watchin and my mothers the dearest
And I ain't neva said they don't appreciate what we do
But jus no if I wasn't a man we wouldn't make it through


(Chorus)2x


Who would have known that this wa some day that didn't turn out so happy
But I chose my own life so I gradually accept it
I'm influenced and effected by the way it became
And I don't play with it at all so I don't say it's a game
And even though I grew apart and I have gracefully change
I'm always strict so I'll forever be facin a change
And I'll keep this thang brutained on the waist of my pants
And I demand respect from all if not then I'm waisten a man
And if I want it then I get and if I need it I have it
Take care of them family first plus tha licka an weed is a habit
And I'm so often I'm congratulated for the succeeded at last
But when they turn they back I just have Jesus leadin my path
And I didn't ask for you to like me I don't care if you hate me
But don't mistake me no otha man can neva make me or break me
Now you faithfully inspired by the hood tell I'm gone
And I dawg I do belive I'm grown so I'll be good on my own but I be like




(Lil Wayne)
Chea, what's up baby
I aint tryin to do nothin but get my grown man on
I aint tryin to hurt you, only if you want me to, ha
Yea, somethin like that


Yea wats happenin baby I'm lil wayne from new orleans
Fresh out the navy now the captain of my own team
Hop in this machine
Banish from the scene
God damnit I'm so manish
Handle it like a standard
So put ur panties and ur pants by the trashcan
Romance on the floor plans
Yea, we hold hands while we rollin
Jus tryin to keep up with the program
Jus tryin to sneak up on ya,
Like how you doin mam
I'm a old soul in a young man,
We got to it and we didn't stop till the birds hit the block
And she aint neva had it like that


Chorus:
Girl, you are so fine
I wish that I could get you over here girl tonight
So I can get my grown man on with you,
You don't kno about it, I'm on my grown man (4x)


Currency
Now I don't really hit the club
But tonight I'll make an exception
For some reason I can't seem to keep my eyes out your direction
I'm lookin at you so hard I could probably catch a charge
Feelin the way you walk when you move your booty applause damn,
I gotta keep my composure
Gotta attack my mission handle business like a soldier
Young man, young money with the money long
Currency tha hot spitta it so grown
And ur perception of me is so wrong
Don't worry bout what you heard bout me and them other birds
Mighta dun a lil dirt and left a few of em hurt
But whateva has occured they all got what they deserved,
And you don't rock like them I can see it in your eyes
If you aint good for me then you wearin a disguise
'cause tonight you lookin like ms right
And I swore to be a player for life but I'll change for you


Chorus


Lil wayne
You aint a woman, you a baby girl livin in a lady's world
And I'm a grown man, the women understand
See what I go thru, is what I owe you
So you should throw that ass back to me right now
Yeah, fly boy baby sit back relaxin,
Cruise wit a nigga, destination satisfaction
Now who's is it baby she say weezy fuckin baby

Then I tell her nevermind and we do it one more time

Long, it wont stop till daytime come home


Chorus


Damn, look, that, oh that right there

Wheres those chanel shades I get you

And I'm always buyin new things

You aint a woman, you a baby girl livin in a lady's world
And I'm a grown man, the women understand
See what I go thru, is what I owe you
And you should throw that ass back to me right now


"One big room full of bad bitches" x8


Fu got the weed, Marl got the gun
They say numbers don't lie
Bitch, I'm not the one
Hammers in ya face, this is not a dream
And you get in every page in this magazine
Bumping ugk, talking about a murder
We roll a Dr. Jay and then we light that Julius Erving
I got p-ssy on the way and p-ssy on the way out
Life is a beach and these hoes trying to lay out
Tunechi, Tunechi, toaster, tooly
F-ck around and pop ya
My homies got that white girl
Call it Lady Gaga
Glock for Tini, nina colada
Suck, swallow, semen, saliva
I'm going at your collar
F-ck you hoe niggas!
Weezy go hard, you bitches go figure
Diamonds in my teeth like I'm a f-cking dope dealer
You're a dead man walking: Michael Jackson Thriller
I'm in one big room, full of bad bitches...


(I'm in one big room, full of bad bitches)


It goes: Tunechi, Tunechi
Toaster, tooly, f-ck around and pop ya
My homies got that white girl
Call it Lady Gaga
It goes: Tunechi, Tunechi
Toaster, tooly, f-ck around and pop ya


Back where I started on my set, in black
All chrome Glock looking like a platinum plaque
We don't pack extra clips, we pack extra Gats
And all my hoes dirty like welcome mats
Til the wheels fall off: I can fix a flat
If you're scared go to church and get a scripture tat
Guns the size of children, now don't be childish
Be with wild-ass niggas and I am the wildest.
I'm a motherf-cker, call me Weezy baby
And on the end of the barrel I got a sweet potato
My life is a movie, I got a leading lady
My rooftop drop back like Tom Brady
I got the world in my hands, skateboard n' my vans
And all my boys stay strapped like we live in Iran
I know what I can do, so bitch I do what I can
Drop the Sorry 4 the Wait, man
I'm just saying...


I'm in one big room, full of bad bitches...

So many back to back hits they call me little Sammie Sosa
Bubble gum, balled up all the hustlers

On the field, on the court, over any hot beat
And break, and you know it when you see your clone
And right now that's all I see goin on, holla at me
Game time, all I think about is bringing home the trophy
If your team is better mine, you really gotta show me
Really gotta beat me, really gotta trash talk
Mistreat me, and send my squad back home

Matter fact, I ain't never lost at all

In the middle of the war where my enemy at

And now these niggas looking yellow like a penalty flag

Dead, he's dead, he's dead, he's dead, sir
He's dead chap, that man's dead back there
It's worst that dead, his brain is gone


I never see your crazy face
Smiling, laughing, screaming my name like that
I never see your crazy face (Mula)
Smiling, laughing, screaming my name like that
I see, smiling, laughing, screaming my name
I see, smiling, laughing, screaming my name

He's dead, he's dead, he's dead
He's dead, he's dead, he's dead
He's dead, he's dead, he's dead


Dead man walkin', through a dead plant garden
Red ants army, Caveman Spartan
Die, come back to life, shaved and corporate
I paved and carved it, made man forfeit
Laid and chalked him, I slaved then bossed it
I don't need flowers around my grave, I need maids and doormen
We not one and the same;
Casper the Friendly, Tunechi Cobain
Ask how I'm livin', I can't complain
Like, it's hot in hell, but it never rain
Shit never sweet, him never changed
I will always be the MF'er Wayne
I been lost conscious, I never regain
Bitches wanna sleep with my remains, lord


Them Xans got me walkin' 'round like a zombie
I just double parked the hearse by a fire hydrant
They throw flowers on my body, allergic to pollen
Rest in peace to the Cash Money Weezy, gone but not forgotten, no


I never see your crazy face (You don't see me, nigga)
Smiling, laughing, screaming, my name like that (You don't see me, nigga, no)
I never see your crazy face (You can't see me, nigga)
Smiling, laughing, screaming, my name like that (You can't see me, nigga, no)
I see, smiling, laughing, screaming, my name (You can't see me, nigga, no)
I see, smiling, laughing, screaming, my name (I'm the muthafuckin' ghost)


He's dead, he's dead, he's dead
He's dead, he's dead, he's dead
He's dead, he's dead, he's dead
He's dead, he's dead, he's dead


Dead man walkin', the weed I'm sparkin'
Stank like corpses, got a young nigga coughin'
I was larger than life, should've got a bigger coffin
Bad bitches in my coffin, suck dick 'til they cough
How long will they mourn me?, I had a Rolls Royce Ghost
Now I'm feelin like that motherfucka comin' back to haunt me
We are not one and the same;
I fumble my brain, I'm nothin' but strange
I punctured my veins, I'm loving the pain
I'm ugly and vain, now go get that shovel and dump it on Wayne
Throw dirt on my name, picture on a shirt instead of a frame
I'm dead as a doorknob and I got it locked
So fuck every key on your key chain, boy


Them Xans got me walkin' 'round like a zombie
I don't know if I'm comin' or going, Lord, I'm undecided
Throw flowers on my body, you allergic to pollen
Rest in peace to the Cash Money Weezy, gone but not forgotten, no


I never see your crazy face (Ohhh)
Smiling, laughing, screaming, my name like that (You don't see me, nigga, no)
I never see your crazy face (You can't see me, nigga)
Smiling, laughing, screaming, my name like that (You can't see me, nigga, no, no)
I see, smiling, laughing, screaming, my name (You can't see me, nigga, no, no)
I see, smiling, laughing, screaming, my name (I'm the muthafuckin' ghost)
I never see your crazy face
Smiling, laughing, screaming, my name like that
I never see your crazy face
Smiling, laughing, screaming, my name like that
I see, smiling, laughing, screaming, my name like that
I see, smiling, laughing, screaming, my name like that


That man's dead back there
It's worst that dead, his brain is gone


Hey
I remember da way
We would both say
We be together
Forever and a day
Well I guess dat day
Came sooner den late
Cus now
We're apart and away
And it feels so stray
N.g.e. wouldn't you say
I use to
Call u bay
And u use to obey
And I just wish we could


"Do it again" [x3]


Hey
I got my business together
Wish I could get together
But timing is an error
And I
Tell a lie
To you like ever
If I was even ever
Given another chance to


"Do it again"


Like I died
And gone to heaven
Climbed inside a treasure
Died inside of pleasure like
Wow
Your smile is but of essence
Your child is so precious
I wish
It was paternally mine
But karma is a message
But imma try to test it
And scream for a blessing
So loud
And I hope that you would catch it
And one day you would come fallin
Out of the most highest cloud
Then I'll be there to catch you
Yes
I'll be there to let you
Do da things
We didn't do before
Now
Next time we have to stretch it
Do it never forget it
I never forgot
I wish dat we could


"Do it again" [x3]


Hey
I'm just trynna talk to you
If I could talk to you
Den I would talk
Forever and a day
Yes I remember
So vividly
How we would be
When we lay
And my then blue skies
Were no longer gray
She so brightened up my day
Put it on a scripture
She would be a picture
If perfect had a face
I promise you homie
Dat u would be hungry like me
If you had a taste
I put it on my momma
Cus baby girl is a flower
A flower without a vase
No water needed at all
She continues to grow
More beautiful everyday
And I love her somethin vicious
And I'm just wishin
We could


"Do it again" [x3]

A fifteen year old shot caller baby
I'm raised in the hood
In a all black call
Down mercedes cool
Got your wife at my house and she naked too
And all my niggas all around us saying shake it boo
Go ahead do what you do
It's weezing darling off that heezing darling
I', surrounded by the ice it got me freezing darling
It's plain and simple
My change and it's natural
Now Wayne will pimp ya'll
Got game from beatrall
Trying to see six numbers
At the grammy awards with six hummers
Me the grammy award with six womans
Nigga stop at the gas station for six rubbers
Put it together
This is the night for you to get under the cheddar
Don't try to end it or you wouldn't get better
CHORUS:
LIL WAYNE:Here I come star rapper
I get the fast money
Short cute hot boy
And rap for cash money
Stand out the roof of my car and flash honeys
Take your girl to the mall and spend a gee like it's nothing
If you lay on the floor
Open up the spot
Take off her draws
Let me see the cot
Don't stop
Lil' Weez lil' weez and nothing nice
But yet to my Jesus Christ
Nothing but ice
When they see me at night
Behind cristal see night
Snatch your wife
Run up in there with the K Y
It's all mine
Ever since I was born Wayne
Nigga get out of line I get dirty like John Wayne
I bought something to floss it
Whatever come with it
Now don't shoot us unless they have a drum with it
At first they weren't with it
But then I was choking
I got 'em all paying attention like they owe it

Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
I roll with a bunch of untamed guerrillas, head bustas, and sharks
Niggas that's 'bout beefin' - lettin' them K's spark
Knockin'-it-off-your-shoulder soldiers - them real niggas
Niggas who did time - hard-to-kill niggas
How you live, you get it is the way a nigga play it
Niggas ain't fightin' no more - niggas bustin' your head
Sendin' you to your grave - it's do or die, cousin
Aimin' straight for your head, makin' sure you die, cousin
They dressin' in black, prepared for combat
Ridin' four deep strapped with choppers and macks
Not givin' a fuck, gettin' your cut, lettin' it bust
You get hit, that's on you, my nigga - you're outta luck
You're stuck like chuck - wodie, you're assed out
That's what happen to ya tryin' to be hard, runnin' your mouth
Get erased, my nigga (my nigga)
Look here: I leave no trace, my nigga (my nigga)
No witnesses so can you see my face, my nigga (my nigga)
Fled the scene - so you have no case, my nigga- -case, my nigga
Look here: you can play if you wanna get down
Get your stupid ass left where you can't be found

I was wrong for a lot of shit that I'ma take to my grave
Continuously whippin' niggas like a runaway slave
Must was meant for me to be thuggin' - I stay in some beef
Baby and Slim keep tellin' me, "Juvenile, stay off them streets."
I can't help - I draw attention; they be fuckin' with me
I'm hot in the ass and can't get enough of these streets
A lil' nigga in the Rolls screamin', "Fuck the police!"
Peelin' out in front the club, about to duck to the east
Now play yourself, you gon' find yourself by yourself
In a nice place ducked off with fucked up health
I done been strucked and snuck, but never fucked and stuck
My life is four hundred degrees, so I bust 'em up
Still stickin' to the g-code, Ree's, and B's
Quit drinkin', but I will smoke some weed indeed
All they understand is my project English
And if you don't like it, you can kiss my penis


(Hook-4x [B. G.])
We done hit you up, lit you up, twist you up (Ooohh!)
We done chopped you up, popped you up, boxed you up (Ooohh!)


I run the streets 'cause I'm real if it's daylight or dark
You a killer, nigga? (Eah?) Ain't no fear in my heart
I'll go toe to toe with ya or take ya to war
I'll even go K for K with ya - now make your choice
Better know when I'm in beef that I be creepin', nigga
Better know that I'm a snake, and I'ma sneak ya, nigga
Each time I hit the corner, I be leavin' niggas
Momma upset - can't even go on and grievin', nigga
Nothin' change - I'm on tv, I don't play with you niggas
Still the same that'll spin broad day on you niggas
And empty a hundred out that K
Where you're caught hangin' is where you're left stankin', ya heard me
I've been in the game - niggas know what I'm 'bout
So many murders under my belt, I done lost count
If you wanna be another number, my nigga
Go ahead, drop your nuts, and run up, my nigga


(Hook [B. G.])

Hello, world
I zip through fast in a yellow pearl drop Porsche Boxter
Young mobster, wild and obnoxious
Pop some in your dreadlocks - What? Me not no rookie, boy
Glock cookin', boy
I'll turn your forehead to a pussy, boy
Off the gate, cousin, you niggas gon' make me stalk and spray somethin'
Spark or lace somethin'
Park the car, get out, walk, and spray somethin'
Taught to stay thuggin' brought up in this shit that we call America
And in my hood the laws are scared of us - we are too terrible
If I live to be old, it's a miracle
'cause the way a nigga hatin' or bitch plottin', the shit's hysterical
That's why I keep me two big guns on blast like a stereo
Come to your burial and kill anybody else who care for you
Don't blame me, society changed me
You haul white, you smash powder all night for the fast dollar
Cut off lights, we masked riders
The hood trash got us in a position we can't shake
With boys we can't break, and due to that you ain't safe, bitch

We think the bible's a comic book

Hollygrove, hollywoood, hollygrove, hollywood, too hollygrove to go hollywood


I went from Bourbon to Beverly Hills
Show me your tits, I'll show you my weapon and grill, and heaven is real
I get an actress into my bedroom, she lay down and say "let's make a film"
I be like action, I hold her hair down by her neck this how breath taking feel
Family first, you'll get your family killed, that's if you squeal
Pop-pop close range hold that gun like the photographer hold the camera still
Bad bitch ridin' my dick, she swerve cuz another bitch grabbin' the wheel
I ask 'em to chill, they tell me to shut up, I say my lips are sealed
I come from Hollygrove, I done went Hollywood
I was a match made in heaven when hell was a pile of wood
I run through hell, with gasoline drawers won't stop tell the devil that god is good
Entrepreneur in a Bentley droptop is off, vagina connoisseur out the hood
I come from Hollygrove, everyday Halloween
We shoot your block up and just say we shot a scene
Been on my beast since I was wearing wallabees
Well paparazzi, I need my privacy, fuck yo photography, I react violently
Make sure your camera get the good side of me, Lawwwd
I come from Hollygrove, Hollywood should make a movie about Hollygrove
Whoo, whoever play me should get a Oscar and a golden globe
This ain’t no movie, this is real shit, I don’t need a script cause I know my role
My Hollywood bitch just overdosed, all she could snort more coke than Pinocchio
I come from the streets but got superstar written all over my face
That’s why these hoes in my face
I come from Hollygrove, I moved to Hollywood just to Californicate
Bapapapaapapappa I ain't finna shoot and tell them don’t check the gate




Fall asleep to the gunshots, wake up and smell the emabalmic fluid
I come from Hollygrove, my bitch from Hollywood
When I fuck her, she say “Hallelujah”
Hollygrove to far from Hollywood
Ohh, but I done went Hollywood
Hollygrove to far from Hollywood
Ohh, but I done went Hollywood


Hollygrove, Hollywood, Hollygrove, Hollywood
I done went way far from H-Town
We used to drive back and forth with the work praying
Lord please don’t let this car break down


H-Town! Lord, Ive done went from Hollygrove to H-town
Hollygrove to Houston
Got a bad 5th ward bitch that be boostin
Sometimes she doze off, that’s the lean I excuse it
She said “If it ain’t chopped and screwed, It ain’t music"
She say I never take her out, We went to eat at Houstons
Sometimes I doze off, that’s the lean, Im just snoozin
I still got actavist, nigga thats exclusive
Kill you for a pint, that’s a PT Cruiser
I see way too many hoes in my future
Im gon nail all them hoes, Im Freddy Krueger
Grew up on Bun B, Pimp C was my tutor
Pimp Squad for life had to do this for Houston


Hollygrove ain’t far from H-town
We used to drive back and forth with the work praying the car don’t break down
Oh, Hollygrove ain’t far from H-town
We used to drive back and forth with codeine, cocaine, the pills, and pounds
Yeah, and we got back home safe and sound
If you got pulled over you don’t give police no names or get killed and never found
Word, but I kept some money to bail out
Momma used to say if I ever get caught, they gon put me under the jailhouse
Damn, Im too Hollygrove to go Hollywood
One to the chest with the chopper leave you with just arms and a head like a octopus
I got this chopper, protecting my livelihood, Im so good, im so straight, I’m secure
Hollygrove, Hollywood, Hollygrove, Hollywood
Too Hollygrove to go Hollywood
Cut


(Verse 1: Lil Syqk)
Syqk, goin 2 hollywood
And I'm checkin out pu##y like a doctor should
With the white skin ass skin like Ivy Wood
And the blonde ass hair like a lion's hood
Bang anybody C. K. Cleveland's back
And I'm rollin on this bitch like a train on a track
And I'm tellin her no like a not and a lack
We done, where is my pre-nup at
Bye!
Starts off like a small town marriage
Lovely wife in life, baby carriage
Now all the stars have cars, success of course
But it ends in Hollywood divorce


And I'm gon' start
Yea, and I don't have to go to Hollywood
Cause Hollywood come through my neighborhood with cameras on
I really think they're stealin from us like a sample song
I really wish one day we'd take it back like?
The hurricane come and took my Louisiana home
And all I got in return was a dern country song
This whole country wrong
What would you write if you just put a little ice on
And cut your mic on
But you don't even write your songs
But Hollywood make you spit like a python
I meant Cobra, I'm so not sober
I'm high like a Hollywood
You can call me a roller
Your grill's glistenin'
Spent a hundred thousand on mine to feel different - what's the real sense of it?
Uhhh Bling bling, I know
And did you know I'm the creator of the term
I just straightened the perm and let it sit too long, they just makin it burn
Make a movie of our lifestyle
But they earn like a dead body burned on a mantlepiece
That's why I try not to lie on wax like this candle grease
And I be's the little nigga cooler than anti-freeze defrost on your window pane - Lil Wayne
But in Hollywood it's Litt-le Wayne
Don't make me not
So that's why I got a pre-nup - I do




Yeah, Yeah
A is for Atomsville
Be is for going home?
C if I give a fuck if you like me you know I don't
If she ain't got a good head on her leave that ho alone
If she do got some good head on her let her sing a song
D is for what I serve, I don't be on no curb
She ain't no junkie neither, I ain't no dope dealer
But she keep comin back 3-stacks, must be some crack
Put that pipe in her lap, she ain't know how to act
Now that I've got your undivided attention I'm gonna say this and run under condition one
Promise me you gon' stack, promise me you gon' ball
Promise me you'll invest three fourths of it all
For what? So your kids, kids, kids can have some cheese
Can't get with it? Get get get get get on your knees
Cause wealth is the word
Rich is round the corner from the curb
Don't like what I write? Shoot me a bird


(Verse 4: Big Boi)
(Starts off)
Tenth grade, the way was paid for me and Dre. To pregate
Like Dr. Frankenstein the arts and crafts
Now could we make a difference
Antoine Patton and Andre Benjamin been jammin for you?, rap niggas and journalists
That's quick to misprint public and private business
Then retract back for deaf ears and think it's dismissed
Part two the sequel all new cast,
Just ain't the same gang of nerds slanndering your name behind that screen name
They're lame and their life is pretty plain
M&M;'s with no nuts
Won't show up face-to-face straight bitch made
Like puppies on the nipples of a mutt
Address it on a case-by-case basis like the judge
What about these lyin' ass hoes tryin to plot
Or these niggas on the block who want the queen (nigga please)
But even she can walk we'll miss her we ain't gon' fake it
But God don't make mistakes must be something bigger?




(Verse 5: Snoop Dogg)
I do, love you but you hate me at the same time
Lights, camera, action, it's game time
Do you take this here as your lovely wife?
To love her and cherish her for all your life?
I solemnly swear to? Share take you there
And me and you together baby we a lucky pair
It's been a long time, we walked a thin line
Of the? I gotcha but you been mine
As I sit back and watch all them cat fights
Domestic violence - is that right?
But you love the dogg, gave me the spotlight
And now I'm growin up, showin up, blowin up
I never ever thought that we would separate at all
But you played me like a game of football
Used to feed me, need me, dress me
Now it's so messy straight cut out and left me


(Andre 3000)
Hollywood divorce
All the fresh styles always start off as a good little hood thing
Look at blues, rock, jazz, rap
Not even talkin about music
Everything else too
By the time it reach Hollywood it's over
But it's cool
We just keep it goin and make new shit


(Snoop Dogg)
Take our game, take our name
Give us a little fame -
And then they kick us to the curb that's a cold thang

I don't know how you like your steak but I'm in rare form
Fuck them bitchass niggas, fuck whoever care for 'em
Momma jumped out a plane, I was airborne
Gold watches, gold chains, watch for Leprechauns

Woah, got me on my Young Money shit


My nigga Chaz Ortiz in this bitch with me
Young Mula!


Young Moulah Baby
Young Moulah Baby


She askin'
"Do you have the time to listen to me whine?"
She askin'
"Who's on the other line?"
You diss me everytime.
I tell 'er "Baby I'm a star
Shit, I'm above a star"
And now I done got so high
I done forgotten who you are


I tell her I'm in love with you
But I can't be with you
Tomorrow I'll be back up on the first flight
Right up out of town


Hop back in my Spaceship
Girl I gotta drop your ass off
(Oh, oh)
Cuz I just come to take it then you know I gotta take off
Girl I gotta take off
(Oh, oh)
But Imma be here next week
So call your company and take off


(Oh, oh) x2


And she say "Wayne you aint shit"
You got me all impatient
Cry me a river
I can hear my conscious while I say aloud


Boy you got a problem (a problem)
And you aint foolin' no one but yourself
Your like a hot revolver (a hot revolver)
But you aint killin' no one but yourself
And so she's gone to party town on her own
And you go by yourself so all alone


One minute she love me the next minute she hate me
That's two minutes of my time she done wasted
She say she pray she has Weezy F's baby
And I be havin' seizures but she say she can't shake me
And my homie say she cuter than my other bitches
And and every time I'm in that pussy it feel custom fitted
I swear I like her more than she think I do
Girl when I think of you my dick just start to jumpin' like a fucking kangaroo
I suck and fuck and finger you but you want me to cling to you
And I aint askin you to change cuz I know I can't jingle you
I got my ways and you have your days
And we gave it our best shot but I just got grazed
I'm sorry


Boy you got a problem
And you aint foolin' no one but yourself
Your like a hot revolver
But you aint killin' no one but yourself
And so she's gone to party town on her own
And you go by yourself so all alone


She owes me everything and she knows it
I've seen all the scenes in this movie, and she blows it at the end
She keeps talking to me, cuz she knows that I'm a friend
But I can't keep hearing it over and over again
I was the one that you came to when you broke up with your boyfriend
Man, fuck him
Girl I was the one, that told you fuck them other niggas
And you still went and fucked them other niggas (niggas)
Most people learn from the bad things
I hope that you learn
And don't crash and burn in the fast lane
But if you read this letter then you caught me
This should explain all the ways that you taught me


How to hate a bitch
That owe you everything
At least a wedding ring
Moving on to better things
So don't you call me talking bout them other fools
I'm not good enough for you
I know that we was cool
If you need a shoulder to cry on, girl I wanna miss it
I'm through fucking with these bitch ass bitches


And I don't love them hoes
But don't fuck up with wayne cuz when it "waynes" it pours
No really, I'm on my "fuck that bitch" shit
You used to be the shit, but now you ain't shit, bitch
I had a red bone, but she be tripping though
All that bullshit is for the birds, she was pigeon-toed
She used to always say, fuck my niggas
And when I went to jail, she fucked my niggas
Well, I guess I'm single for the night
And you can sit right on my middle finger for the night
And if I sound mad, then you caught me
But this shit explains that you're the one that taught me




Coke in the ciroc
Forgive and forget, bitch I already forgot
I'm over the bitch, and she over the top
They say love is the key, somebody changed the lock
Well, and I wish I never met ya
And I heard you're doing you, and you heard I'm doing better
And all I had to do was put two and two together
But that just makes four, but not four-ever, damn
So much for being the perfect couple
I put in overtime, I was working doubles
I wish you the best, good luck boo
Weezy f, for fuck you


No ain't nothing going on
Girl I'm moving on, just take your ass home
Get away from here, girl I'm so glad you're gone
This is the last song I'm writing for you
Now I see how you can be
I don't want you 'round you me
All you do is down me girl
How many years I tried to get ya
Don't even text my phone when it hit ya, cuz girl you taught me






You had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love
How to love


You had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in the corner tryna put it together
How to love
How to love


For a second you were here
Why you over there?
It's hard not to stare, the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love
Never had a love


When you was just a young'un you're looks but so precious
But now your grown up
So fly it's like a blessing but you can't have a man look at you for 5 seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself so when you got older
It's seems like you came back 10 times over
Now you're sitting here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder


See you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out

For a second you were here
Why you over there?
It's hard not to stare the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love
Had a love


You had a lot of dreams that transform to visions
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasn't your fault
Wasn't in your intentions


You the one here talking to me
You don't wanna listen
But I admire your poppin bottles and dippin'
Just as much as you admire bartending and stripping
Baby, so don't be mad
Nobody else trippin
You see a lot of crooks and the crooks still crook


See You had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love
How to love


See you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in the corner tryna put it together
How to love
How to love


Oooh,
See I just want you to know
That you deserve the best
You're beautiful
You're beautiful
Yeah


And I want you to know, you're far from the usual
Far from the usual


You see you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love

See you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in the corner tryna put it together
How to love

See you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in the corner tryna put it together
How to love

Cut the music up
A lil' louder

You had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart

How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn't last forever

Te fuiste pero nunca me dijiste adios
Me dejaste en mil pedazos por no saber amar como amar?
La vida va pasando tu carita no a cambiado
Esos ojitos negros que siguen suplicando como amar como amar?
Te acuerdas de esa noche eramos adolescentes queria darte un beso
Y tu tan inocente me tenias locamente enamorado, me tenias locamente enamorado.
Y ya lo ves, lo que fue ya fue te marchaste poco a poco de mi lado y yo sigo locamente enamorado aqui sigo locamente enamorado.
Te fuiste pero nunca me dijiste adios me dejaste en mil pedazos por no saber amar como amar?
La vida va pasando tu carita no a cambiado esos ojitos negros que siguen suplicando como amar

How to love, how to love

All my exes live in texas like I'm george strait
Or they go to georgia state where-
Tuition is handled by some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel, and we never waited
I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go, told them don't even plate it
And we never talk too much after I blew up
Just only 'hello' or 'happy belated'
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that's when she text me and told me she prayed it
And that's when I text her and told her I love it
And right after texting, told her I'm faded
She asked
What have I learned since getting richer
I learned working with the negatives could make for better pictures
I learned hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though it's fucked up, girl, I'm still fucking wit ya
Damn, is it the fall
Time for me to revisit the past
It's women to call
There's albums to drop, there's liquor involved
There's stories to tell, we been through it all
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my dressing room, confusing me with questions
Like:


Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is wit' you?
And I say
(And I say) hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right
Fuckin' right, all right
(And we say) hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right
Fuckin' right, all right


So much for being optimistic
They say love is in the air, so I
Hold my breath until my face turn purple
Keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like ain't no curfew
Bitch if you wave, then I will surf you
I flew jet, she flew commercial
But we still met, later that night
After my session, she came over
I was aggressive, and she was sober
I gave her pills
She started confessing and started undressing
And ask me to hold her
And so I did, but that was last month
And now she's texting me, asking for closure
Damn
She say this shit gon' catch up to me
I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me
And she wish I was average
Shit, sometimes I wish the same
And I wish she wasn't married
Promises, I hope I never break 'em
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation but
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom confusing me with questions like


Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is wit' you?


(And I say) hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right
Fuckin right, all right
(And we say) hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right
Damn right, all right


(And we say) hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right
Fuckin' right, all right
(And we say) hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah

How 'bout I make it metal
I'm such a fatal fellow
And she's the reason why
Because without the muthaf-cker I'd die
I'd die, I'd die
So bury me today or tomorrow
Cause I've buried myself away
In the sorrow in May
I die before I wake
I pray I'm resurrected for her nightmares sake


But you love me
At least that's what she said
That whole weekend in my bed
But there was a speaker in my head
Saying "seek and you'll be led"
But instead, instead I loved you
I was weak and mislead
I was deeper than dead
I was sinking in dread now I'm thinking in shreds
So I inked this in red


But she loves me
She loves me not


I hate love
Yeah I hate love
Oh my God
I hate love


I used to tell myself I wouldn't do this to myself
Until I proved it to myself
And now I'm losing myself
I used to have my shit together but now
You see now, I with whatever
And now, you see, now, you with whoever, forever and ever
And everybody know I aint acting like I'm supposed
I'm attacking my own soul
I'm back in a lone mode
I'm back on that long road
And that road goes forever and ever


I don't wanna love no more, spare me
You can have my heart it's only dead beat
I'm sick of the love songs and the bullshit
When reality bites like a wolf bitch
She's on top, she wanna kiss
She wont stop, she don't wanna quit
Then I woke up and I wish I could sleep forever and ever


She loves me
She loves me not
I hate love
Yeah I hate love
Oh my God
I hate love


And I don't want love, I don't want love
I don't wanna love no more
So if you see her you can have her
She'll be outside my door
So tell a preacher, tell a doctor
I curse the very day you were born
Tell my lawyer to tell a judge that I'm guilty

Young money mothafucka
Uhh huh
That's right
Now don't you know
Ima beast
Eastside
Up in tha beat


Straight from the bottom of the cut
I give it to these bitch niggas like momma taught me
One man with no weopon at war, but I'm an army
My flow is capital attention lieutenant your penit pension
And they demolished that invention
You better get your dollars up
And guess what, I was up
I get my cheese like mickey mouse
Or else you better donald duck
Like a shooting range target
I get all kinda bucks
Be my shooting range target
Nigga I got good luck
Nigga bye bye good luck
Got your momma shook up
Lil bad ass nigga, who thought popeye wasn't tough
I'm on that lala twist it up
I'm on that syrup slow it down
And I like four freeks too, and I aint young jock but its going down
I buy that marijuana field, then I just smoke it down
Big bad wolf yes I just blow it down
No homo and to holly grove I will hold it down
Like a circle of knives I got the sharpest flow around

Bitch I'm Mack Maine
I got tha heart of a king, blood of a slave
Feel like I been there before, my second time to the grave
But its one life to live, that's why I'm gettin paid
Off a flow that's priceless, I just got it appraised
Spit like I need a raise
Blaze as I gaze, at the stars and ask the lord
Why the culprit at the pall pit
It make me sick to my stomach
That's why I rap, like a pregnant woman I don't spit I vomit
So pay homage me and wayne two G's
Like twenty hundreds
And we keep the semi's blunted
And we live like brothas from anotha
So fuck with him and mack gonna react like you did me something
That's a hint to you David
Throwin shots at Goliath
This the new testament, where the victor is tha giant
So you should get your way and lose the hate
Remember males shouldn't be jealous, that's a females trait

I stepped on a fly, on a petal
Girl was a ho so I sat over better
I'm on my way to get it, but get it got shot
So I guess I gotta work with the little bit I got
Like "hey, I like the view from here!"
I'm so high I can't see you from here


Both eyes on the money, it's looking back at me
And these bitches just looking for a daddy
Pussy getting problems, can't live without em
The weed too loud, turn up the volume
Richer than a bitch, but I can't buy tomorrow
That's why I go hard, ho
God bless the world, and most people in it
It's anybody's name, but nobody's winning
Mona lisa smile, that bitch barely grinning
Take you off the face of the earth like a blemish
We wen't from boyz to menace, menace ii society
Now we get high, call that shit karate
Blame it on the money, the money is the bad guy
Smoke so much good, I don't even have a bad side
Yeah, I got a pussy hangover
Bitches eat me up like my name is russell stover
Murder the perception, make em get it right
If I'm flirting with affection, I'm fucking her that night
I'm a southern delight, louisiana pride
The belly of the beast, it ate me alive
Tell them bitches they'll never take me alive
Ever since the day that I took a walk outside


And I stepped on a flower
On the petal
I'm on my way to get it, but get it got shot
So I guess I gotta work with th elittle bit I got
I'm so high I can't see you from here
Both eyes on the money, it's looking back at me
And these bitches just looking for a daddy
Pussy getting problems, can't live without em
The weed too loud, turn up the volume
Richer than a bitch, but I can't buy tomorrow
That's why I go hard, ho

I got my solja rag and dangled my shit


I was down to just to hang wit you shit


And I banged to the boogie bang bang wit yo click


And I aint even from the 3(3rd Ward), my hood was angry at me, shit


But I rose to my feet, played the post wit the heat


At them shows while you performed and posed


I was waitin for a nigga to jump, see I was patient but was ready to duck


'cause you my brother chump


Real Gs never buckle up


But every family aint filled wit gangstas that's real

We dug, we hung, we ate, we slept


We lived, we died, I stayed, you left


Remember how we played to the left


And we stayed out of trouble 'cause we stayed to our self


Member Slim and B would leave and hand the ki's over


Tell me not to go Uptown and we went straight to tha Nolia


While I watched you reunite wit yo soljas


And yo moms and brother, while I lied to the stunna


Yea those were the times my brother

Pick your jaw up off the floor
And tuck your tongue right back in,
