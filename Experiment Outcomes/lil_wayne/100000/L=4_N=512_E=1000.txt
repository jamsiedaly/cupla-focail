Continuously whippin' niggas like a runaway slave
Must was meant for me to be thuggin' - I stay in some beef
Baby and Slim keep tellin' me, "Juvenile, stay off them streets."
I can't help - I draw attention; they be fuckin' with me
I'm hot in the ass and can't get enough of these streets
A lil' nigga in the Rolls screamin', "Fuck the police!"
Peelin' out in front the club, about to duck to the east
Now where your noce, yea that's what my people call me
Fifty pow-texh in my click on cacturise

The first vain and the I is one big work
Poison to baf a riss around and curvy
And I don't own a rope comf out the little video coffer
Old pass in the backbout, no stack

It's probably on the web, like I'm a deeper

Life is a movie but sometimes a nigga get too tired of watchin' and walk out


Takin' over, now I'm takin' over
Dropped the Sorry 4 The Wait until the wait is over
Sippin' lean out a flask, nigga
And all I do is smoke, fuckin' thrash, nigga


And this the Sorry 4 The Wait 2
Fuck these haters, throw your board up if you skate too
I send my goons to kill somebody, I need head proof
Then they come through and sit it on my coffee table
Tunechi, niggas don't appreciate you
You've been down since day 1, it meant nothin' on take 2
Sometimes the truth is hard to swallow and to say too
But I graduated from that bullshit, now I hate school


And now I'm takin' over, now I'm takin' over
Old me dead and gone, that's who I'm prayin' over
Might have to go back to slangin' yola 'til the wait is over
If so then I got bakin' soda, I got bakin' soda

Why you over there?
It's hard not to stare the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love
Had a love


You had a lot of dreams that transform to visions
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasn't your fault
Wasn't in your intentions


You the one here talking to me
You don't wanna listen
But I admire your poppin bottles and dippin'
Just as much as you admire bartending and stripping

And I get hit up with all kinda stress and put up wit the stuff
Just trust me it's tough but I mantain to climb through it all and I still manage to be
Lil wayne therefore I shine and I ball
And dawg I live for today and hope and pray that there's a tomorrow
And I borrow confidence from out my heart when thangs get awful

Go, I'm in love with a beauty, she is a cutie
Somebody say they saw us kissin' in da movies
We had a drink or two, we saw Rush Hour 2
Then we went home and we made our own movie


Lights, camera, action, ya mama and not that one.
Hotter than diebares
Greeding proof like a trunk love me
That's how it going on it,
We bought a Midniciju the next me
Tune
You can save me the rim
Matter of saying shake it boog's bigger
Cause he ain't it right Ferrious
She sick trick, don't make dat money, yea I'm back in the air
Now I don't sleep my money..... Triggaboolly, Mulu Souch
So I moved outta my condo and into the bank vault
Record sales... Bank Teller say hahah...
Shout out to every dj, bootleggers, I made histor-y anyway
In the way, they said I couldn't
Shout out to Young Money cuz without them I couldn't
Shout out to Cash Money cuz without them I coudln't
Shout out to Universal cuz without them I couldn't
Shout out to my friends cuz without them I couldn't
Shout out to my daughter cuz without her I wouldn't
Mad rappers look on the bright side
I sold 1. 5 Hip Hop is alive
Hahahh thank you everybody
Young mullah baby!


I see you with your palms in your pants
But me, me, see me, I got the world in my hands
I make it spin on my finger
I'm a critical thinker
I'm a hell of a smoker, and a bit of a drinker
I know your name, yea
Your name is "unimportant"
We in the belly of the beast
And she thinking bout abortion


I woke up this morning, dick rock hard
Ashed my blunt in my grammy award
You can save your bullshit on your memory card
If this real nigga business, then you niggas unemployed
Jumped on the celly, called makaveli
He says he was gravy, I say I was jelly
Looked in the mirror, said "you's an I'll nigga"
Now I think I'll have me a coffee with six sugars
In a world full of ass-kissers and dick pullers
I'm trying to walk a straight line but the line crooked
I'm shooting for the stars, astronauts dodge bullets
Yea, I bought a brand new attitude
The haters music to my ears, I got my dancing shoes
Sometimes we question shit that there is no answer to
But I just built a house on "I don't give a fuck" avenue




Down on the ceiling, looking up at the bed
Life is a gamble better check the point spread
And when life sucks, I just enjoy the head
I'm so sick of these niggas, I need meds
Smoking on a hallelujah, thank you jesus
Help me focus on the future, and not the previous
Double are, I'm a rebel with a reason
Sometimes you gotta fight the devil with a demon
Blood is in the streets and it is up to my knees
Underground shit, I see myself as a seed
Living in the glass, and everybody's looking
How can you get the picture, if you don't know who took it?
This current affairs, but who the hell cares?
Everybody's fighting over position, musical chairs
On the road to redemption, go on and use a few stairs
I'm just fucking ready so I come prepared




And the rockets red glare
The bombs bursting in air
Life is a rollercoaster but still unfair
A blessing in disguise
Says thank you for our eyes
But since it is in disguise
We don't know that it's there
And I...


I know your name...


Young desperado straight out the grotto
I'm so bad my shadow chooses not to follow
Little nigga but see me as a fuckin' rhino
Lil Weezy hit this bitch like Rocky Marciano
It's a drought ain't it? How the fuck would I know?
Nigga I been gettin' my Cher in (share in) like Sonny Bono
I ran the streets... Check my bio
I started high wit' two O's just like Ohio
I'm fuckin' nuts... Cashews
But I'm so dc like fat shoes
I skate away... Like later dudes!
Never get caught baby I'm mashed potato smooth
And just when it stopped... I made it move
Respect me nigga I'm a dog... No Asian food
I wet up the party so have a bathin' suit
And daisy dukes you bitch ass nigga


Keep talkin' that shit that you talkin'
And we gon' have to get into some gangsta shit
My nigga... Keep talkin' that shit that you talkin'
And we gon' have to get into some gangsta shit
My nigga... 'Cause you aint really even 'bout all that
You ain't really even 'bout all that
And don't'cha forget.. I know ya you ain't 'bout all that
You ain't never been about all that... Fall back

Like you never had a love, never had love


When you was just a young'un, your looks were so precious
But now your grown up, so fly it's like a blessing
But you can't have a man look at you for 5 seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself so when you got older
It's seems like you came back 10 times over
Now you're sitting here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder


See you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love

I'm higher than a bitch, feel like I climb a fucking mountain,
Illest nigga you know my accountant still counting
Shots hit him a minute ago, but he's body still bouncing!
Beam on the hammer, beam on your forehead,
Gotta kill the witnesses cause birdman car red
Hollygrove monster, eagle street creature,
Come to your funeral, kill everybody but the preacher.
I live in miami, nigga, I'll south beach ya
Robin Leach uh that's how we balling!
You know that I'm loaded, but please don't think it's sweeter,
Beat one of you bitch niggas up like john cena
Then hoes on yo money taught me


I got some money on me
I'm 'bout to kill these hoes
I don't be politicing, I'm not political
F-ck you talkin' bout, bitch I'm Kenneth Cole
My goons masked up, Ray Mysterio
Bitch, eat something, I don't like skinny hoes
I hit her from the back, she on her tippy toes
I smoke that P-arebs 40 shots as I like my pen
And anyhew out in ya mirror and I love been her dead


I don't wanna love no more, spare me
You can have my heart it's only dead beat
I'm sick of the love songs and the bullshit
When reality bites like a wolf bitch
She's on top, she wanna kiss
She wont stop, she don't wanna quit
Then I woke up and I wish I could sleep forever and ever


She loves me
She loves me not
I hate love
Yeah I hate love
Oh my God
I hate love


And I don't want love, I don't want love
I don't wanna love no more
So if you see her you can have her
She'll be outside my door
So tell a preacher, tell a doctor
I curse the very day you were born
Tell my lawyer to tell a judge that I'm guilty

So I guess I gotta work with the little bit I got
Like "hey, I like the view from here!"
I'm so high I can't see you from here


Both eyes on the money, it's looking back at me
And these bitches just looking for a daddy
Pussy getting problems, can't live without em
The weed too loud, turn up the volume
Richer than a bitch, but I can't buy tomorrow
That's why I go hard, ho
God bless the world, and most people in it
It's anybody's name, but nobody's winning
Mona lisa smile, that bitch barely grinning
Take you off the face of the earth like a blemish
We wen't from boyz to menace, menace ii society
Now we get high, call that shit karate
Blame it on the money, the money is the bad guy
Smoke so much good, I don't even have a bad side
Yeah, I got a pussy hangover
Bitches eat me up like my name is russell stover
Murder the perception, make em get it right
If I'm flirting with affection, I'm fucking her that night
I'm a southern delight, louisiana pride
The belly of the beast, it ate me alive
Tell them bitches they'll never take me alive
Ever since the day that I took a walk outside


And I stepped on a flower
On the petal
I'm on my way to get it, but get it got shot

And the streets was calling me, but a nigga had call waiting
And yeah we all went through our phases
We all went through our savings
Some niggas stayed on point, some niggas was point shaving
And sometimes we had to be vegetables
That mean we had to stay patient cause they say you are what you eat
I took the Star out of Starvation, bitch
I come from a 3rd world start rapping in the 4th grade
Start trapping in the 6th grade, went platinum in the 10th grade, dropped out a nigga was getting paid
This from Birdman had a Fade,
This when Hummers didn't come Stretch but Birdman had em' made,
This when pretty bitches set you up, and niggas didn't give two fucks
You had two guns and two phones you could waste time and get and get a new cup
But this when niggas had pimp cups, and new rappers got hemped up
And all them niggas that's biting got they Finns cut...
I know real niggas gon' fuck with this
Like "that's that shit I be talkin' 'bout"

And if the Feds bring us in we get the same time Gotti Got
And if the Feds bring us in we get the same time Gotti Got
And if the Feds bring us in we get the same time Gotti Got


But this when niggas had pimp cups, and dirty money got rinsed up
And the early birds in the worm hole would get so fat that they'd get stuck
We'd clean our fingerprints up, we'd clean the shit we didn't touch, This when niggas called Diddy Puff
Letting Biggie bump while I'm sitting up in that Big Body
I can show you a dead body
Lotta niggas got pinched, and the snitches ended up dead Lobsters
Wrap the birds in red tape call them bitches Red Robins
Pops had Kilos I needed one key I would've made Cops
Free My niggas Down and Rest In peace to all my dead Partners,
I smoke by the pound in like a week, and fuck the weight watchers
Got my self a brand new triple-beam, just the weight options
I stumbled upon a Gold Mine I thank God that it ain't Copper
Some niggas were late bloomers but boy look how they've blossomed
Don't know niggas that wear wires but I know niggas that go Haywire
I know hoes that play possum, and will bring us to y'all mailboxes
And the deadman can't talk and the Feds don't have seances
Look you put a knot on the end of a condom full of drugs and put it in her pussy
And get through Customs cause last time we just took em
I rather be blind before I be the nigga that stand around just lookin'
And you can beat around the bush and find a nigga laying behind them bushes
And I know real niggas gon' fuck with this
Like "that's that shit I be talkin' 'bout"


And we gon be around til yo motherfuckin' body rock
And if the Feds bring us in we get the same time Gotti Got
And if the Feds bring us in we get the same time Gotti Got

Now I'm left to race the rebel
Bartender make it several

And she's the reason why
Because without the muthaf-cker I'd die

In the sorrow in May
I die before I wake
I pray I'm resurrected for her nightmares sake


But you love me
At least that's what she said
That whole weekend in my bed
But there was a speaker in my head
Saying "seek and you'll be led"
But instead, instead I loved you
I was weak and mislead
I was deeper than dead
I was sinking in dread now I'm thinking in shreds
So I inked this in red


But she loves me
She loves me not


I hate love

Oh my God

Until I proved it to myself
And now I'm losing myself
I used to have my shit together but now
You see now, I with whatever
And now, you see, now, you with whoever, forever and ever
And everybody know I aint acting like I'm supposed
I'm attacking my own soul
I'm back in a lone mode
I'm back on that long road
And that road goes forever and ever


I don't wanna love no more, spare me
You can have my heart it's only dead beat
I'm sick of the love songs and the bullshit
When reality bites like a wolf bitch
She's on top, she wanna kiss
She wont stop, she don't wanna quit
Then I woke up and I wish I could sleep forever and ever


She loves me
She loves me not
I hate love
Yeah I hate love
Oh my God
I hate love


And I don't want love, I don't want love
I don't wanna love no more
So if you see her you can have her
She'll be outside my door
So tell a preacher, tell a doctor
I curse the very day you were born
Tell my lawyer to tell a judge that I'm guilty
