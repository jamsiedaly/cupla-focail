It was all a dream

Missouri with we like me
Hoes an world they be so this to my feeling when flues in trouble

Smoke good, eat good, live good
Smoke good, eat good, live good

I'm feeling like a suicidal terrorist
React like an infant whenever you are mentioned
Mind over matter never worked for my nemesis
I'm in the matter of man arm wrestling hands

God damn I feel amazing, damn I'm in the matrix
My mind is living on cloud 9 and this 9 is never on vacation
Start up that Maserati and vroom vroom! I'm racing
Poppin pills in the lobby and I pray they don't find her naked

I tell her beautiful, and how long it took
For you to put it on
It was early in the morn'
She resembled a model out of a questiot and bad G's
Fuck, she's hard enourin' the world can as face
But it's been a long time comin, I should hang with you

Don't run out of ammo lately been working on my handles
Can I ball, become a star, and remain my self
If I fall, dust it off and regain my self
Fuck 'em all, they don't know all the pain I felt
